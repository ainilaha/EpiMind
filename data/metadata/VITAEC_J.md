### Vitamin A, Vitamin E & Carotenoids (VITAEC_J)

####  Data File: VITAEC_J.xpt

##### First Published: May 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Vitamin A**

Worldwide, vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable blindness.
Although vitamin A deficiency is uncommon in the U.S., it is associated with
excess morbidity and mortality from infectious disease in developing
countries. Toxicity related to excess consumption of vitamin A can lead to
permanent liver damage and death. Serum retinyl esters are of interest
generally only in fasting specimens and are used to indicate potential
hepatotoxicity in subjects with elevated serum retinol concentrations.****

**Vitamin E**  

Vitamin E has low potential for toxicity. Elevated serum vitamin E
concentrations are only of concern in people receiving anticoagulant therapy.
Low serum concentrations are rarely observed, except in those with
malabsorption syndromes. Gamma-tocopherol is the most common dietary form of
vitamin E, found in high concentrations in seed oils and nuts, but its serum
concentration is substantially lower than that of alpha-tocopherol. For
example, the geometric mean ratio of alpha- to gamma-tocopherol in NHANES
2005-2006 was 1090 to 188 ug/dL, which is a 6-fold difference. While alpha-
tocopherol is preferentially retained in the liver, gamma-tocopherol is
actively metabolized and excreted. Only alpha-tocopherol sets the standard for
vitamin E deficiency.

**Carotenoids**  

A physiological need for the carotenoids, except as vitamin A precursors, has
not been established. Excess consumption of carotenoids may cause red or
orange discoloration of the skin as a result of carotenoid deposits in
subcutaneous fat. Several xanthophylls are found in the macular pigment in the
eye where they may protect against macular degeneration.

While there are some common characteristics, each class of analytes has
distinct chemical properties and physiological functions. The following five
analytes: retinol, alpha-tocopherol, lutein/zeaxanthin, lycopene, and beta-
carotene are generally present in measurable amounts in most sera. These
analytes are either required nutrients or have been associated with health
effects in epidemiological studies. Less is known about health effects
associated with the other analytes (lycopene, alpha-cryptoxanthin, beta-
cryptoxanthin, cis-beta-carotene, and gamma-tocopherol).  

The objectives of this component are to provide data for monitoring secular
trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; to evaluate
the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the
use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional
status; and to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health
policies including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and
child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population.

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum concentrations of retinol and vitamin E (alpha- and gamma-tocopherol),
two retinyl esters, and seven carotenoids are measured using a modification of
a high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection
method. A small volume (100 mL) of serum is mixed with an ethanol solution
containing two internal standards--retinyl butyrate and nonapreno-beta-
carotene (C45). The micronutrients are extracted from the aqueous phase into
hexane and dried under vacuum. The extract is re-dissolved in ethanol and
acetonitrile, and it is filtered to remove any insoluble material. An aliquot
of the filtrate is injected onto a C18 reversed phase column and isocratically
eluted with a mobile phase consisting of equal parts of ethanol and
acetonitrile. Absorbance of these substances in solution is linearly
proportional to concentration (within limits), thus spectrophotometric methods
are used for quantitative analysis. Three wavelengths, approximately
corresponding to absorption maxima, namely, 300, 325, and 450 nm, are
simultaneously monitored and chromatograms are recorded. Quantitation is
accomplished by comparing the peak height or peak area of the analyte in the
unknown with the peak height or peak area of a known amount of the same
analyte in a calibrator solution. Calculations are corrected based on the peak
height or peak area of the internal standard in the unknown compared with the
peak height or peak area of the internal standard in the calibrator solution.
Retinol and the retinyl esters are compared with retinyl butyrate at 325 nm,
alpha- and gamma-tocopherol are compared with retinyl butyrate at 300 nm, and
the carotenoids are compared with C45 at 450 nm.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.  

This is a new component in the 2017-2018 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Vitamin A, Vitamin E & Carotenoids
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/VITAEC-J-
MET-508.pdf) (May 2022)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  
  
NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.  
  
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Thirteen calculated variables were created in this data file. The variables
were created using the following formulas:

**LBDALCSI:** The alpha-carotene value in Î¼g/dL (LBXALC) was converted into
umol/L by multiplying LBXALC by 0.01863 (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBXARYSI:** The alpha-crytoxanthin value in Î¼g/dL (LBXARY) was converted
into umol/L by multiplying LBXARY by 0.01810 (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDBECSI:** The trans-beta-carotene value in Î¼g/dL (LBXBEC) was converted
into umol/L by multiplying LBXBEC by 0.01863  (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDCBCSI:** The cis-beta-carotene value in Î¼g/dL (LBXCBC) was converted into
umol/L by multiplying LBXCBC by 0.01863  (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDCRYSI:** The beta-cryptoxanthin value in Î¼g/dL (LBXCRY) was converted
into umol/L by multiplying LBXCRY by 0.01810. (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDGTCSI:** The gamma-tocopherol value in Î¼g/dL (LBXGTC) was converted into
umol/L by multiplying LBXGTC by 0.02402. (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDLUZSI:** The combined lutein/zeaxanthin value in Î¼g/dL (LBXLUZ) was
converted into umol/L by multiplying LBXLUZ by 0.01758. (Round to 3 decimal
points).

**LBDLYCSI:** The trans-lycopene value in Î¼g/dL (LBXLYC) was converted into
umol/L by multiplying LBXLYC by 0.01863. (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDRPLSI:** The retinyl palmitate value in Î¼g/dL (LBXRPL) was converted into
umol/L by multiplying LBXRPL by 0.03491. (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDRSTSI:** The retinyl stearate value in Î¼g/dL (LBXRST) was converted into
umol/L by multiplying LBXRST by 0.03491. (Round to 3 decimal points).  

**LBDLCCSI:** The total lycopene value in Î¼g/dL (LBXLCC) was converted into
umol/L by multiplying (LBXLCC) by 0.01863. (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDVIASI:** The vitamin A (retinol) value in Î¼g/dL (LBXVIA) was converted
into umol/L by multiplying LBXVIA by 0.03491. (Round to 3 decimal points).

**LBDVIESI:** The vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) value in Î¼g/dL (LBXVIE) was
converted into umol/L by multiplying LBXVIE by 0.02322. (Round to 3 decimal
points).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/FASTQX_J.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending "LC" (ex., LBDALCLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXIHG) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDALCLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in Âµg/dL) for Vitamin A, E and
carotenoids:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXALC |  alpha-carotene (Âµg/dL) |  0.7  
LBXARY |  alpha-crypotoxanthin (Âµg/dL) |  0.2  
LBXBEC |  trans-beta-carotene (Âµg/dL) |  0.8  
LBXCBC |  cis-beta-carotene (Âµg/dL) |  0.7  
LBXCRY |  beta-cryptoxanthin (Âµg/dL) |  0.9  
LBXGTC |  gamma-tocopherol (Âµg/dL) |  11.0  
LBXLUZ |  Lutein and zeaxanthin (Âµg/dL) |  2.4  
LBXLYC |  trans-lycopene (Âµg/dL) |  0.8  
LBXRPL |  Retinyl palmitate (Âµg/dL) |  1.3  
LBXRST |  Retinyl stearate (Âµg/dL) |  0.7  
LBXLCC |  Total Lycopene (Âµg/dL) |  1.0  
LBXVIA |  Retinol (Âµg/dL) |  1.0  
LBXVIE |  alpha-tocopherol (Âµg/dL) |  40.0  
  
**2017-2018 Gamma-Tocopherol Measures Were Corrected for Spillover from High
Beta-Cryptoxanthin Concentrations Channel**

A portion of the 2017-2018 gamma-tocopherol data were re-measured to correct
for spillover from beta-cryptoxanthin and included in the present dataset. The
data for re-measurement were selected based on high concentration of beta-
cryptoxanthin (>16 ug/dL).

As mentioned in the above Description of Laboratory Methodology section,
carotenoid beta-cryptoxanthin was measured at its visible absorbance maximum
of 450 nm; however, the CDC's testing laboratory discovered that it also
showed some spillover on the UV 300 nm channel for gamma-tocopherol at exactly
the same retention time. The spillover causes an artificial increase in gamma-
tocopherol. A HPLC column that separated beta-cryptoxanthin from gamma-
tocopherol was identified. Based on evidence that the concentrations of beta-
cryptoxanthin and gamma-tocopherol were positively related, all samples with
beta-cryptoxanthin >16 ug/dL (n=1,160) were re-measured. The average drop in
gamma-tocopherol once the spillover was removed was 9.9 Â± 15.4 ug/dL. Of the
1,160 re-measured samples, only 142 had spillover more than 20 ug/dL gamma-
tocopherol, which is about 12% of the re-measured gamma-tocopherol results.
The data released in the present file reflect the 1,160 re-measured values
with spillover removed. To verify the selection criteria, a small subset of
samples (n=32) with beta-cryptoxanthin <16 ug/dL were also re-measured, and a
smaller spillover effect (6.8 Â± 11.7 ug/dL) was observed.

To our knowledge, the observed spillover from high beta-cryptoxanthin
concentrations has never been documented in the literature. Gamma-tocopherol
was last measured in NHANES 2005-2006, and those measurements also contained
similar spillover. The geometric means of gamma-tocopherol in the NHANES
2017-2018 data set are about 30-50 ug/dL lower than those reported in NHANES
2005-2006, across various gender, age, and race-Hispanic origin groups. Given
the magnitude of the spillover effect observed among 2017-2018 samples, it
seems unlikely that the observed differences between the two cycles can be
solely explained by the spillover. However, data users should be aware of this
when interpretating the results.
