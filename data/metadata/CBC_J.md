# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2017-2018 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Complete Blood Count with 5-Part Differential (CBC_J)

####  Data File: CBC_J.xpt

##### First Published: February 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The complete blood count (CBC) with 5-part differential counts red blood cells
(RBCs), white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets; measures hemoglobin;
estimates the red cellsâ volume and sorts the WBCs into subtypes. A CBC is a
routine blood test used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide
range of disorders, including anemia, infection, and leukemia.

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to whole blood levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further
define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention
and health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 1 year and over were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The methods used to derive CBC parameters are based on the Beckman Coulter
methodology of counting and sizing, in combination with an automatic diluting
and mixing device for sample processing, and a single beam photometer for
hemoglobinometry. The WBC differential uses VCS technology.

The Beckman Coulter DxH 800 instrument in the NHANES mobile examination center
(MEC) produces a CBC on blood specimens and provides a distribution of blood
cells for all participants.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Complete Blood
Count](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/CBC-J-
MET-508.pdf) (September 2019)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood specimens were analyzed in the NHANES Mobile Examination Center.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM).](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the NHANES laboratories. In the MEC, the CBC results are measured in
duplicate and averaged.  The averaged results are reported to participant and
released in this dataset.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during the analysis of the specimens, summary statistics
for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Five derived variables were created in this data file. The variables were
created using the following formulas:

LBDLYMNO = LBXWBCSI * LBXLYPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDMONO = LBXWBCSI * LBXMOPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDNENO = LBXWBCSI * LBXNEPCT /100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDEONO = LBXWBCSI * LBXEOPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDBANO = LBXWBCSI * LBXBAPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
[NHANES Tutorial ](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, the length of fast and the time
of venipuncture.

The laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes.  The variable ending in
âLCâ (ex., LBDHGBLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above the limit
of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection.  The other varible prefixed LBX ()ie., LBXHGB) provides the
analytic result for that analyte.  For analytes with analytic results below
the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDHGBLC = 1), an imputed value was placed
in the analyte results field.  This value is the lower limit of detection
divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The lower and upper limits of
detection for CBC:
