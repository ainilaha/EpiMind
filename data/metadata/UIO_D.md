### Iodine - Urine (UIO_D)

####  Data File: UIO_D.xpt

## Component Description

Iodine (Hollowell et al., 1998), an essential element for thyroid function, is
necessary for normal growth, development, and functioning of the brain and
body. Iodine-deficiency disorder (IDD) is a well documented global health
problem, affecting more than a billion people worldwide. Consequences of IDD
include goiter, cretinism, intellectual impairment, brain damage, mental
retardation, stillbirth, spontaneous abortions, miscarriages, congenital
deformities, and increased perinatal mortality. Progress toward eliminating
IDDs has been substantial; an estimated 70% of the world's edible salt
currently is iodized. Most excess iodine is excreted, and most people can
tolerate fairly large amounts without experiencing problems. People with a
tendency toward autoimmune thyroid disease are less tolerant of excess iodine.
If a person has previously been iodine-deficient, that person may be at risk
for iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Excessive iodine intake by a mother can
pose a reproductive risk. Since urinary iodine values directly reflect dietary
iodine intake, urinary iodine analysis is the recommended and most common
method for biochemically assessing the iodine status of a population. This
method achieves rapid and accurate quantification of iodine content in urine.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older on a 1/3 sample were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine iodine and mercury concentrations are determined by ICP-DRC-MS
(Inductively Coupled Plasma Dynamic Reaction Cell Mass Spectroscopy). This
multielement analytical technique is based on quadrupole ICP-MS technology (5)
and includes DRC™ technology (6, 7). Coupling radio frequency power into a
flowing argon stream seeded with electrons creates the plasma, the heat
source, which is ionized gas suspended in a magnetic field. Predominant
species in the plasma are positive argon ions and electrons. Diluted urine
samples are converted into an aerosol using a nebulizer inserted within the
spray chamber. A portion of the aerosol is transported through the spray
chamber and then through the central channel of the plasma, where it is
exposed to temperatures of 6000-8000?K. This thermal energy atomizes and
ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass spectrometer through
an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating at atmospheric
pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer, which is
operating at approximately 10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer permits detection
of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio in rapid sequence, which allows the
determination of individual isotopes of an element. Once inside the mass
spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion optics, then through DRC™, and
finally through the mass-analyzing quadrupole before being detected as they
strike the surface of the detector. The ion optics uses an electrical field to
focus the ion beam into the DRC™. The DRC™ component is pressurized with an
appropriate reaction gas and contains a quadrupole. Electrical signals
resulting from the detection of the ions are processed into digital
information that is used to indicate the intensity of the ions and
subsequently the concentration of the element. Traditionally ICP-MS has been a
trace analysis technique and the typical measurement ranges from < 0.1 μg/L to
around 100 μg/L. DRC technology provides additional control of ICP-MS
sensitivity; therefore appropriate adjustments of the reaction cell parameters
can significantly extend the useful concentration measurement range. In this
method, iodine (isotope mass 127), tellurium (isotope mass 130), mercury
(isotope mass 202) and bismuth (isotope mass 209) are measured in urine by
ICP-DRC-MS using 100% argon as the Dynamic Reaction Cell™ (DRC) gas utilizing
collisional focusing. Urine samples are diluted 1+1+ 8 (sample+ water +
diluent) with water and diluent containing tellurium and bismuth for internal
standardization.

The urinary iodine method was modified from the previous 2 years. Urine iodine
concentrations were determined by Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS) during NHANES 2003-2004. Urine iodine concentrations were determined
by ICP-DRC-MS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Dynamic Reaction Cell Mass
Spectroscopy during NHANES 2005-2006.

## Data Processing and Editing

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary iodine were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6
years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2005-2006
Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2005-2006 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

All the urinary iodine measures were above the limit of detection (1.0 μg/L)
for all samples. The detection limit divided by the square root of 2 is the
value that is provided for results that are below the limit of detection.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
