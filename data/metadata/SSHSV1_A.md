### Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 (Surplus) (SSHSV1_A)

####  Data File: SSHSV1_A.xpt

##### First Published: October 2006

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (15-<20% of records) that were initially included
in error. No data values were altered. However, survey weights were newly
created. For each analyte included in this data file, it was determined that
overall and for stratified sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin groups, the
updated file using the new sample weights resulted in an estimate within the
95% confidence limit calculated using the original file and sample weights.
However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries related to
this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

Sera from consenting children age 6-13 years examined in NHANES 1999-2002 were
tested for antibodies to Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 (HSV-1) using a solid-
phase enzymatic immunodot assay. Purified glycoprotein specific for HSV-1
(gG-1) was used as antigen. All results in this data release are reported as
positive or negative or indeterminate.

## Eligible Sample

All participants 6-13 years from NHANES 1999-2002 who gave consent for further
testing using stored sera (n = 3,115).

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Although extensive antigenic cross-reactivity exists between the two viral
types of herpes, a viral glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) (designated gG-2), and a glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex
virus type 1 (HSV-1) (designated gG-1) have been identified. Monoclonal
antibodies and affinity chromatography have been used to purify these
glycoproteins and thus provide antigens for type-specific herpes serologic
assays. Solid-phase enzymatic immunodot assays are used to detect antibodies
reactive to these antigens. The purified glycoprotein gG-1 is adsorbed to the
center of a nitrocellulose disk. The rest of the disk surface is coated with
bovine serum albumin (BSA) to prevent further nonspecific protein adsorption.
Incubation of test serum with the disk allows specific antibodies, if present,
to bind to the immobilized antigen. After extensive washing to remove non-
reactive antibodies, the bound antibodies are detected by sequential treatment
with peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG and the enzyme substrate (H2O2
with chromogen 4-chloro-1-naphthol). A positive reaction is demonstrated by
the appearance of a blue dot at the center of the disk. Serum reactive to an
immunodot charged with gG-1 indicates previous and probable latent HSV-1
infection.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data was received after all the antibody testing was complete. The data were
not edited.

Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Assay performance was monitored throughout the testing period by testing
positive and negative controls derived from reference sera. gG-1 immunodot
results were run in duplicate and 2% were randomly repeated.

## Analytic Notes

SSHSVGG1 (HSV-1 antibody)  
1= positive  
2= negative  
3= indeterminate

**Subsample Weights**

Sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data. When observations were removed from this data file,
new sample weights were created and  added to this data file (WTSSHS2Y,
WTSSHS4Y). Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
