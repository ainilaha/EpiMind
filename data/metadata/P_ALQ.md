## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

## Eligible Sample

All participants ages 12 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic sample were eligible; however, only data from participants who were
ages 18 and over are included in this file.

A special use data file for participants ages 12-17, P_ALQY_R, is available
through the [NCHS Research Data Center
(RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/index.htm).

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The ALQ section was administered at the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) during
the MEC Interview, except the question on binge drinking frequency in the past
30 days (ALQ170), which was asked at the end of the in-person dietary
interview in the MEC. For adults 18 years and older, questions were asked, by
trained interviewers, using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI)
system. A proxy provided information for survey participants who were could
not answer the questions themselves.

The NHANES
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/questionnaires/ALQ_CAPI_J.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/questionnaires/ALQ-
CAPI-K-508.pdf) alcohol use questionnaires are available on the NHANES
website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

For details on the QA/QC process for this component, please refer to the
2017-2018 [MEC Interviewer
Procedures](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Interviewers_Procedures.pdf)
and 2019-2020 [MEC Interviewer
Procedures](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-Interviewer-
Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) manuals, and the 2017-2018 [MEC In-Person Dietary
Interviewers
manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_In-
Person_Dietary_Interviewers_Manual.pdf) and 2019-2020 [MEC In-Person Dietary
Interviewers

Person-Dietary-Interviewers-Manual-508.pdf) on the [NHANES
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical values.
Because the data are based on self-reports, not all inconsistencies could be
resolved. It is recommended that analysts review the data carefully prior to
analysis.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

The NHANES ALQ asked to adults 18 years and over were not changed between the
2017-2018 and 2019-2020 data collection cycle. However, the NHANES alcohol
questions asked to adults 18 and over were changed between the 2015-2016 cycle
and the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic cycle. These changes are described in the
[Analytic
Notes](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/ALQ_J.htm#Analytic_Notes) of
the 2017-2018 alcohol use data documentation.

Question ALQ170 was asked in a different component (i.e., in-person dietary
recall interview), and there will be respondents to ALQ170 without any other
alcohol use data and vice versa. Consistent with the approached used in the
National Health Interview Survey, the phrase "on an occasion" was self-defined
by each participant.

All the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic ALQ data were collected in the
MEC; therefore, exam sample weights should be used for the analyses. Please
refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Ftutorials%2Findex.htm)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
