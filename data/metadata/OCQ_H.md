## 2013-2014 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Occupation (OCQ_H)

####  Data File: OCQ_H.xpt

##### First Published: July 2016

##### Last Revised: December 2019

##### Note: Industry and occupation group code variables have been added for
participant's current and longest held jobs.

## Component Description

The Occupation Questionnaire (variable name prefix OCQ) section (questions
OCD150 to OCD395), which is part of the household interview, contains Survey
Participant interview data on employment and variables relating to the work
environment.

OCQ section Topics:

  * Data for Survey Participant's Current Job (OCQ180-OCD270): weekly hours worked, public vs. private sector, industry and occupation group, and duration of employment; and 
  * Data for the Sample Participant's Longest Job (OCD390G-OCD395): industry and occupation group, duration of employment. 

## Eligible Sample

The OCQ was administered to a full sample of survey participants aged 16 years
and older.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, during the household interview, by
trained interviewers using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI)
system. Persons 16 years of age are interviewed directly.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. During the 2013-2014 data
collection cycle, periodic QC checks were performed on the OCQ data being
collected and interviewer specific feedback and retraining was performed as
appropriate.

## Data Processing and Editing

Questionnaire interview responses were entered into a tablet and then uploaded
into a computerized database in the same manner as other sections of the
Survey Participant Questionnaire. The data was then edited for completeness,
consistency, and illogical values.

## Analytic Notes

In general, analysts are advised to carefully review the question wording in
the OCQ codebook to make sure they understand question skip patterns and the
definitions employed for occupation-related variables. Some OCQ questions need
to be considered as an integral part of data collection for other
questionnaire sections, exam or laboratory components.

Please note that military occupations are not permissible entries for NHANES
current job data because for NHANES, only the civilian, non-institutionalized
population is eligible to participate. However, civilian employees of the
armed forces are included in the NHANES sample and military occupations are
valid entries for the survey participant's longest job data.

Current Job Information:  
The primary focus of the OCQ is data collection for the participant's work
within the previous week (i.e., the participant's Current Job). The
participant's Current Job is defined as the main paid job worked within the
last week, including work on a family farm. When an individual currently
worked multiple jobs, the participant was asked to designate one main job for
the interview.  
Data collected included:

  * The number of hours worked last week--all jobs; 
  * Whether the participant usually works 35 or more hours/week; 
  * Industry and Occupation group code data; 
  * Sector of employment (private, public); 
  * Number of months worked on the current, main job; and 
  * The main reason the participant did not work last week (if not currently working).   

Longest Job Information:  
In NHANES 2013-14, both industry and occupation data and duration of
employment were collected for the subject's Longest Job. Industry information
is also available in instances where the longest job is the same as the
current job (OCD390G=2), or was the armed forces (OCD390G=3).

Related NHANES 2013-14 Data:  
There are occupation-related items in the NHANES Physical Functioning (PFQ)
questionnaire (PFQ049 and PFQ051) and two questions on veteran's
status/military service in the Survey Participant Demographics (DEMO) data
file (DMQMILIZ and DMQADFC).

Industry & Occupation Coding:  
Four-digit codes were applied to the NHANES 2013-2014 occupation and industry
data using the 2010 U.S. Bureau of the Census Industrial & Occupational
Classification coding system. The coding was done by the Division of
Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies (DSHEFS), which is part of
CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In the
OCQ_H public release data file, group code variables are provided that
classify an NHANES survey participant to one of 22 industry groups and to one
of 23 occupation groups. Access to the more detailed four-digit occupation and
industry variables is available through the NHANES Research Data Center (RDC).

Over the past seven cycles, the coding system used to code NHANES data have
changed. Researchers need to review these coding systems to ensure that they
are coding and interpreting their findings correctly.

  * As mentioned above, the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was used for detailed coding of the NHANES 2013-2014 occupation and industry group data. 

  * The U.S. Census Bureau's 2002 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was used for detailed coding of the 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012 occupation and industry group data.

  * The U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was used for detailed coding of the 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006 occupation and industry group data.   

The 2000, 2002, and 2010 versions of the Census Bureau Industry and Occupation
codes are comparable in many, but not in all respects, and data analysts who
wish to combine NHANES cycles together should consult NIOSH's documentation on
the comparability of the these 3 versions of the Census Bureau's coding system
and available crosswalks before performing their analyses.

Coding manuals, detailed data dictionaries of the alphabetical and classified
indices of industries and occupations, and information about crosswalks
between the coding systems are available (NIOSH, 2017).

Appendix A provides SASâ„¢ program format statements useful for formatting the
NHANES 2013-14 occupation and industry group code data. Appendix B provides
tables showing the detailed U.S. Census occupation and industry source codes
used in creating the NHANES 2013-14 occupation and industry group codes.

Detailed occupation and industry codes for the 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and
2003-2004 cycles are not available through the RDC, and at this time, there is
no timeline to release them.

The OCQ data were collected as part of the household questionnaire and,
therefore, the full sample NHANES interview weights WTINT2YR should be used
for statistical analysis. However, if the OCQ data are merged with the MEC
exam or laboratory data, then the NHANES examination sample weights WTMEC2YR
should be used for analyses. Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
