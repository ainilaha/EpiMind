### Pesticide Use (PUQMEC_F)

####  Data File: PUQMEC_F.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2011

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Pesticide Use section (variable name prefix PUQ) provides survey
participant level interview data on pesticide use in the home and lawn or
garden during the past 7 days.

## Eligible Sample

The questions in this section were asked of proxy respondents for children 6
and 7 years of age; and were asked of respondents 8 years of age and older.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

A trained interviewer administered these questions to the survey participants
during the MEC interview and of proxy respondents for children 6 and 7 years
in the Dietary Recall.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The pesticide use questionnaire (PUQ) data were systematically reviewed for
logical, processing, and data input errors on a periodic basis during the
process of data collection.

The computer CAPI system had built-in consistency checks, online information
screens that provided the interviewers with information about the terms used
in the questionnaires, and hard and soft edit checks to reduce the number of
keying entry errors. All of the data were reviewed by the NHANES field office
staff for accuracy and completeness.

## Analytic Notes

The Pesticide Use section (variable name prefix PUQ) was administered in the
MEC interview for all participants aged 8 years and older. These questions
were asked of proxy respondents for children 6 and 7 years in the Dietary
Recall. Two questions on pesticide use in the home and lawn or garden during
the past 7 days were administered.

Although these data were collected as part of the household questionnaire, if
they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used for
the analyses.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website.
