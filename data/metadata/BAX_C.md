### Balance (BAX_C)

####  Data File: BAX_C.xpt

##### First Published: December 2005

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Balance disorders constitute a major public health concern, especially for
older persons, who are an increasing segment of the U.S. general population.
For example, balance disorders are thought to be causally related to some
200,000 hip fractures that occur annually in Americans over the age of 65. The
objectives of the Balance Component are

  * to obtain accurate prevalence data on balance problems among a sample of U.S. adults; 
  * to examine the relationship between balance problems and specific covariates such as certain medical conditions and indicators of health status; and 
  * to help characterize normal and disordered balance and spatial perception. 

The NHANES 2003-2004 Balance Component consists of 2 parts:

  1. A pre-exam screening questionnaire. This is a series of questions that identify conditions which would constitute either practical or safety exclusions to performing Balance testing. Please note that more extensive survey questions relating to balance problems are contained in the BAQ section of the NHANES household survey questionnaire; and 
  2. Balance Testing, consisting of a modified Romberg Test of Standing Balance on Firm and Complaint Support Surfaces.

## Eligible Sample

The 2003-2004 Balance Component tested a full sample of U.S. adults 40 years
of age and older. There were five principal exclusion criteria applied in the
Balance testing protocol. These were:

  1. at the time of the exam, an examinee felt unable to stand on his or her own; 
  2. at the time of the exam, an examinee was currently having dizziness sufficient to cause unsteadiness; 
  3. weight over 275 lbs; 
  4. an examinee needed a leg brace in order to stand unassisted; 
  5. an examinee had an amputation of their feet or legs. 

In addition, subjects who were totally blind or visually impaired sufficiently
to require assistance in finding the exam room were disqualified, as were
those who had a waist circumference either too small or too large to
accommodate proper fitting of any standard sized safety gait belt. Also, the
Mobile Examination Center (MEC) physician could exclude subjects if it was
considered medically contraindicated to perform testing.

## Protocol and Procedure

The Romberg Test of Standing Balance on Firm and Compliant Support Surfaces
examines the ability of the examinee to stand unassisted under four test
conditions, ordered in increasing level of difficulty.

In Test Condition 1, the subject stands making use of all the sensory inputs
that contribute to balance: the central vestibular system, vision, and
proprioception (leg muscle position sense).

Test Condition 2 tests balance when only vestibular and proprioceptive
information is available (the subject closes the eyes to eliminate visual
input).

In Test Condition 3, the subject must maintain balance on a foam-padded
surface, which reduces the proprioceptive input, leaving only visual and
vestibular cues.

Finally, in Test Condition 4 (also using a foam pad), the eyes are again
closed (visual input is removed) and the subject's ability to maintain balance
is tested using only his vestibular system.

All Balance Testing was scored on a pass/fail basis, with Test Conditions 1
and 2 conducted for a total of 15 seconds, and Test Conditions 3 and 4
conducted for 30 seconds each. Test failure was defined as:

  * a subject needed to open the eyes in an eyes-closed Test Condition (#2 or #4); 
  * the subject moved the arms or feet in order to achieve stability; or 
  * the subject began to fall or required MEC Technician intervention to maintain balance. 

In the standard Balance Testing protocol, each subject is eligible for an
initial test and one re-test to pass a specific Test Condition. Within each
Test Condition, the protocol for retesting is the same as for the primary
examination. Because each successive Test Condition from 1 to 4 is
progressively more difficult than the Condition preceding it, the Balance
Testing Component is ended whenever a subject fails to pass a Test Condition.

Balance testing was conducted with the utmost consideration for subject
safety. The examining MEC Technician stood immediately to the side of the
participant prepared to stabilize the subject by the use of a safety gait belt
should significant unsteadiness occur. Also, the examination was conducted in
a small exam room, with well-padded walls and floor.

For the procedures relevant to this component, please refer to the Survey
Operations Manual, Consent Documents, Brochures on the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

All data from each of the sections of the Balance Component were directly
entered by MEC technicians into ISIS, a computerized database information
system. Technicians selected for the Mobile Examination Centers were
professionally trained in the Modified Romberg Testing protocol by an expert
consultant in Balance and Vestibular disorders. In addition, Audiologic
Consultants from the National Institute of Occupational Safety & Health
(NIOSH) and contractor staff provided performance monitoring of each
Technician on a regular, periodic basis. Additionally, NCHS staff visited the
MECs approximately twice per year to observe the Balance examinations and
verify that standard testing procedures were being strictly followed by
technicians. All MEC Balance technicians also received annual retraining and
updates by the NIOSH consultants. Finally, exclusion rates and outcome
statistics were continually monitored by NCHS statisticians according to
technician and MEC, and retraining was conducted as necessary to maintain test
quality.

For details on the QA/QC process for this component, please refer to the
Interviewer Procedure Manuals on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

As mentioned previously, all data were captured in ISIS, a computerized
database. NCHS statisticians performed data reviews on an ongoing basis using
a computerized data editing program to check for logical inconsistencies in
the data and technician errors, as well as to cross-check other issues
affecting data quality. Back-end edits of the data were performed as necessary
where errors were detected. The 2003-2004 Balance Examination data were re-
reviewed for errors and logical consistency and verified against the primary
examination data database prior to public release.

## Analytic Notes

Because the NHANES 2003-2004 Balance examination was administered in the MEC,
the full sample MEC examination sample weight should be used for data
analysis. For information on the use of sample weights in NHANES data
analysis, refer to the NHANES 1999-2000 Addendum to the NHANES III Analytic
Guidelines. Analysts who wish to combine Balance data from NHANES 1999-2000
with the NHANES 2001-2002 or 2003-2004 Balance examination data should be
aware that the sampling frame for NHANES 1999-2000 Balance Examination data
differed from that for the 2001-2004 Balance data. Specifically, NHANES
1999-2000 Balance data were collected for a one-half sample of U.S. adults
ages 40-69 years, whereas NHANES 2001-2004 Balance was collected for a full
sample of U.S. adults ages 40 and older. Special half-sample weights are
available on the NHANES 1999-2000 Balance data set and are to be used when
analyzing the data for those years. For combined 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 data
analysis, special 4-year Balance subsample weights are provided (WTSBA4YR) on
the 2001-2002 Balance dataset. Six-year data analysis (1999-2004) is performed
by combining the 4-year Balance subsample weights with the 2003-2004 MEC
examination weights according to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines.

Data analysts should ideally be familiar with Balance and Vestibular
disorders, or have a specialist available for consultation. The systematic
differences in testing length (15 seconds for Conditions 1 and 2; 30 seconds
for Conditions 3 and 4) may need to be taken into account for the analysis.
The variable BAAEXCMT provides coded data summarizing the reasons that an
examination was incomplete (partial) or not done.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues at

No data related to this component are in the Research Data Center.
