### Erythrocyte Protoporphyrin (L39_B)

####  Data File: L39_B.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2004

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are:

  1. to provide data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population;
  2. to evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status; and
  3. to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. 

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 1 year and older were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Centers for Disease Control**

Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) is measured by a modification of the
method of Sassa et al. Protoporphyrin is extracted from EDTA whole blood into
a 2:1 (v/v) mixture of ethyl acetate acetic acid, then back extracted into
diluted hydrochloric acid. The protoporphyrin in the aqueous phase is measured
fluorometrically at excitation and emission wavelengths of 404 and 658 nm,
respectively. Calculations are based on a processed protoporphyrin IX (free
acid) standard curve. After a correction for the individual hematocrit is
made, the final concentration of protoporphyrin in a specimen is expressed as
micrograms per deciliter (g/dL) of packed red blood cells (RBC).

**State of New York Department of Health, Wadsworth Center, Trace Elements
Laboratory**

Porphyrins and heme components are extracted from whole blood into a 4:1
mixture of ethyl acetate-acetic acid. Porphyrins are then separated from heme
by back-extraction into a 1.5 M hydrochloric acid solution, and quantitatively
determined by molecular fluorometry using a spectrofluorometer calibrated with
protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) standard solutions; however, the exact concentration
of the standards must first be established using molecular absorbance, Beer's
Law, and the millimolar absorptivity of PPIX.

The analytical method for EP routinely employed by the EP Lab is based largely
on those originally described by Sassa et al. (1973) and Chisolm and Brown
(1975). New York State's extraction method owes much to contributions from
other public health labs, including the CDC, and closely follows the key
elements of the consensus method for EP as published by the National Committee
for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS C42-A*, 2001). At the invitation of
Dr. Sassa, the EP Laboratory's routine method for EP was published as Unit 8.8
in Current Protocols in Toxicology, 1999 by J. Wiley & Sons, Inc. Elements of
this protocol are reproduced below, but a reprint of the original publication
is available from the EP lab director.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. A detailed quality control
and quality assurance instruction was discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Data Processing and Editing

Specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, National Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia in 2001 and to the State of
New York Department of Health, Wadsworth Center, Trace Metals Laboratory,
Albany, New York in 2002. Detailed specimen collection and processing
instructions was discussed in the NHANES LPM. Read the LABDOC file for
detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods were
described in the Description of the Laboratory Methodology section.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2001-2002 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2001-2002
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such
as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and
phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.

The Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention performed testing from 1999-2001.
The State of New York Department of Health, Wadsworth Center, Trace Elements
Laboratory began testing in 2002.
