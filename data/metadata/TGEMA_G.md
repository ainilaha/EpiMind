### Tissue Transglutaminase Assay (IgA-TTG) & IgA Endomyseal Antibody Assay
(IgA EMA) (TGEMA_G)

####  Data File: TGEMA_G.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Tissue transglutaminase assay (IgA-TTG) and the IgA endomyseal antibody assay
(IgA EMA) estimates the prevalence of celiac disease in the United States
population. Celiac disease is an intolerance to dietary glutens that has
protean manifestations. In population surveys in other countries, it is found
in about 0.5 to 1 percent of the population. It may well be as common in the
United States, but has not been adequately examined. Advances in diagnostic
testing now allow accurate disease prevalence estimates using two step
serological testing. To provide reliable population estimates, four to six
years of data collection are required.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum specimens were processed, stored and shipped to the Mayo Clinic,
Rochester, Minnesota. Detailed instructions on specimen collection and
processing can be found in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists
Procedures Manual (LPM)

**Tissue transglutaminase assay (IgA-TTG)**

An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) for the semi-quantitative
detection of IgA antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (endomysium) in human
serum. Microwells are pre-coated with recombinant human tTG antigen. The
calibrators, controls and diluted patient samples are added to the wells and
autoantibodies recognizing the tTG antigen bind during first incubation.
Unbound proteins are removed during washing and purified peroxidase conjugate
is added which binds to the captured human autoantibody; excess is washed. TMB
substrate is added which gives a blue reaction product, intensity is
proportional to the concentration of autoantibody in the sample. Phosphoric
acid is added to stop the reaction which gives the yellow color. Plate is read
at 450 nm.

**Endomyseal antibody assay (IgA EMA)**

Endomysial antibodies of the IgA subclass present in the serum bind to the
reticulin component of the endomysium of the smooth muscle in monkey esophagus
tissue and can be detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Substrate-bound IgA
antibody is identified with a fluorescein-conjugated anti-human IgA
(Fab2-specific) conjugate. Positive staining is identified as a reticulated
lace-like pattern on perimucosal smooth muscle bands. Sera positive for
endomysial antibody are titered to end-point dilutions.

## Data Processing and Editing



## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/fastqx_g.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

 Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
