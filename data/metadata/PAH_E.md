### Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) - Urine (PAH_E)

####  Data File: PAH_E.xpt

#####  First Published: February 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Urinary Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**

PAHs constitute a group of chemicals which are formed during the incomplete
combustion of coal, oil and gas, garbage, and other organic substances. In
general, people are exposed to mixtures of PAHs, and the sources are
widespread, including vehicle exhausts, asphalt, coal tar, wild fires,
agricultural burning, charbroiled foods, and tobacco smoke. PAHs enter the
body quickly and easily by all routes of exposure and are readily and
predominantly metabolized to hydroxylated metabolites and glucuronide
metabolites. These compounds require metabolic activation in order to interact
with cellular macromolecules. Measurement of urinary metabolites indicates
exposure to the parent PAHs. Although background ranges of PAHs in air and
water are known, less is known about PAH background levels in humans.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The specific analytes measured in this method are monohydroxy-PAH (OH-PAH).
The procedure involves enzymatic hydrolysis of urine, extraction,
derivatization and analysis using capillary gas chromatog-raphy combined with
high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). This method uses isotope dilution
with carbon-13 labeled internal standards. Ions from each analyte and each
carbon-13 labeled internal standard are monitored, and the abundances of each
ion are measured. The ratios of these ions are used as criteria for evaluating
the data. By evaluating these analytes in urine, a measurement of the body
burden from PAH exposure is obtained.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol
for all the laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running
NHANES specimens. Summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS. NCHS reviewed the data for
trends or shifts. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard 1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary PAHs were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6
years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES  laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all but four of the analytes in the
data set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable
named URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection.
There are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above
the limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for
that analyte. In cases, where the result was below the limit of detection, the
value for that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of
two.

For URXPO2,and URXP06 variables in cases where the result was below the limit
of detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided by
the square root of two.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
