### Cancer antigen CA125, CA15.3 and HE4 IgG antibodies - Serum (Surplus)
(SSCGA_B)

####  Data File: SSCGA_B.xpt

##### First Published: August 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Sera from residual specimens from NHANES 2001-2002 participants were tested
for levels of IgG antibodies against cancer antigen (CA) 125, CA15.3 and human
epididymal secretory protein 4 (HE4). The results are reported as relative
luminescence units and as an index of relative specific autoimmune reactivity
compared to non-specific/heterophilic IgG binding to albumin.

## Eligible Sample

Female participants age 20+ who consented to storing their samples for future
research and had stored samples from 2001-2002.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

All measurements were performed in the Genital Tract Biology Laboratory
(Brigham and Women's Hospital, Lab Director Fichorova) following pre-analytic,
analytic, and post-analytic standardized operational procedures (SOPs)
established under the Laboratory Director and special chemistry accreditation
by the College of American Pathologists. The lab used the Meso Scale Discovery
(MSD) (Gaithersburg, MD) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay platform.
Quality control (QC) pools were prepared and split into multiple aliquots. To
establish inter-and intra-plate variability, one aliquot of this pool was
repeatedly tested on each assay plate. A coefficient of variation of < 25% was
set as a threshold for acceptance of the data.

In further detail, the following assays and methodology were applied:  

Human Custom Antibody Assay 7-spot, 3-plex, MSD, cat # N75YA-1  

Assay design: For this custom assay design, the Laboratory of Genital Tract
Biology provided to Meso Scale Discovery the following proteins to be coated
each on one spot of the 7-spot test plates: Human antigen grade CA125 purified
from an ovarian cancer cell line (Meridian Life Sciences Inc, Memphis, TN, cat
# A97180H), human antigen grade CA15.3 derived from human breast cancer BTA
cell line supernatant (Meridian, cat # A32000H), and recombinant full-length
human HE4 expressed in HEK 293 cells (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, cat #ab152016).

The CA125 antigen preparation showed analytically negligible contamination
with other mucins (<0.23% for CA19-9 and <0.01% for CA15-3, by Elecsys).  The
CA15.3 antigen preparation also minimal contamination with CA15.3 (0.2%, Cobas
CA19-9 Assay) and CA125 (2.49%, Cobas CA125 Assay). The purity of the
recombinant HE4 antigen was > 95%, determined by SEC-HPLC and reducing SDS-
PAGE (full length sequence of the recombinant protein:
EKTGVCPELQADQNCTQECVSDSECADNLKCCSAGCATFCSLPNDKEGSCPQVNINFPQL
GLCRDQCQVDSQCPGQMKCCRNGCGKVSCVTPNFVDHHHHHH). The remaining four spots of the
7-spot plate were coated by MSD with bovine serum albumin.

The assays included blocking with a blocking buffer for 1h and with sample
diluent for 30 minutes, followed by PBS/0.05% Tween-20 wash; 2h incubation
with samples at multiple dilutions followed by wash; detection of human IgG
bound to the specific protein spots with an MSD sulfo-Tag-labeled mouse
monoclonal detection antibody (10 Î¼g/ml) for 2h; washing and adding read
buffer followed by detection of electro-chemiluminescence (ECL) using an MSD
Imager S600.  All NHANES serum biospecimens were tested at a 10-fold dilution
and repeated at a 50-dold dilution if producing an outlier value in the
specific antigen or albumin spots.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

A quality control (QC) pooled sample was generated from pooling equal volumes
of serum samples from ovarian cancer cases and split aliquots of the QC pool
were tested at three different dilutions (2, 10, 50 and 250-fold) in
triplicate on each assay plate to determine intra- and inter-assay variation.
The Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as 100*standard deviation of
replicate values / average or replicate values. The acceptable QC pool
variation was set to 25%. Back fit analysis of each calibrator was also set to
25% acceptable level. Outliers were confirmed by repeated testing. The
following intra- and inter-assay CV of the three dilutions (2x, 10x and 50x)
tested were recorded for the specific IgG reactivity:  1) Intra-assay CVs
were:  CA15.3 - 3.7 % (2x), 9.4 % (10x), 15.5% (50x) and 17.9 % (250x); CA125
- 8.9 % (2x), 9.4 % (10x), 11.8 % (50x) and 15.5 % (250x); HE4 - 15.5 % (2x),
10.2 % (10x), 8.4 % (50x) and 8.2% (250x); 2) Inter-assay CVs were: CA15.3 -
9.9 % (2x) 15.5 % (10x) and 22.4 % (50x) and 87.2% (250x); CA125 - 20 % (2x),
17 % (10x), 23 % (50x) and 30.3% (250x); HE4 - 28 % (2x), 24 % (10x) and 22 %
(50x), and 22.4% (250x). The QC data showed that while IgG binding to some of
the antigens (CA5.3) was below precision range at the 250x dilution, both the
10x and 50x dilutions chosen for the screening of all NHANES samples generated
reliably reproducible signal of IgG binding to all three mucin antigens.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data was compiled into a database after all the assays were completed and
passed quality control criteria. The data were not edited.

Data Access: All data will be made publicly available.

## Analytic Notes

The results are reported as relative luminescence units (RLU) and as an index
of relative specific autoimmune reactivity compared to non-
specific/heterophilic IgG binding to albumin calculated as average RLU of
specific antigen spot divided by average RLU of signal from 4 BSA-coated
spots.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
