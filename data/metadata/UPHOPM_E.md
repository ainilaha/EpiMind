### Pyrethroids, Herbicides, & OP Metabolites - Urine (UPHOPM_E)

####  Data File: UPHOPM_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Pyrethroid pesticides are synthetic analogues of pyrethrins, used to control a
range of insects in residential, commercial and agricultural settings, and
they may be applied on animals to control insect infestation. Pyrethroid
insecticides are among the most common active ingredients in commercially
available insect sprays and are also used as structural termiticides.
Permethrin is used in skin lotions and shampoos as a medical treatment for
lice and scabies. Pyrethroid insecticides do not persist in the environment
because they are rapidly degraded within days to months. Human metabolism of
pyrethroids occurs rapidly, and metabolites are eliminated in urine and bile
over several days. Two of the urinary metabolites measured are unique to
specific pyrethroids: 4-fluoro-3-phenoxyacetic acid from cyfluthrin and
cis-3-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid from
deltamethrin. The other urinary metabolites can result from exposure to any of
several pyrethroid insecticides. Because pyrethroid insecticides are widely
used in the U.S. population, measuring urinary pyrethroid metabolites is
important to evaluate human exposure and potential for health effects.

Of the two herbicides measured in urine, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
(2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), only 2,4-D is
currently registered for use in the U.S. 2,4-D is widely used to control
broadleaf weeds in residential, agricultural, and aquatic environments. It
degrades in soil over days to weeks and is rarely detected in ground waters.
2,4-D is not metabolized by humans and is eliminated unchanged and rapidly in
the urine. Because 2,4-D is widely used in the U.S., measuring urinary 2,4-D
is important to evaluate human exposure and potential for health effects.

The specific organophosphorus insecticides with urinary metabolites measured
are chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos-methyl (3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol or
TCPy), diazinon (2,-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine or IMPY), malathion
(malathion dicarboxylic acid or MDA), and methyl and ethyl parathion (para-
nitrophenol or PNP). Chlorpyrifos and malathion are widely used in residential
and agricultural insect control, and chlorpyrifos-methyl and diazinon are
restricted to agricultural applications only. Methyl parathion has extremely
limited agricultural use, and ethyl parathion is no longer registered for use
in the U.S. Each of these measured urinary metabolites can also result from
environmental degradation of the parent organophosphorus insecticide. Human
metabolism of these organophosphorus insecticides results in the specific
metabolites named above, dialkylphosphate metabolites, and other metabolites,
all which are eliminated in urine over a few days. Detecting any of these
urinary metabolites in a person's urine may indicate exposure to the specific
organophosphorus insecticide or to the environmental breakdown product or
both. Because several of these insecticides are widely used in the U.S.,
measuring these urinary organophosphate insecticide metabolites is important
to evaluate human exposure and potential for health effects.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The approach followed is a modification of previous methodology (Beeson et al.
1999; Olsson et al. 2004). The target analytes are extracted and concentrated
from the urine matrix using an automated solid phase extraction system.
Selective separation of the analytes is achieved using high-performance liquid
chromatography with a gradient elution program. Sensitive detection of the
analytes is performed by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a heated
electrospray ionization source (Davis et al. 2013). Analytes are identified
using the specific m/z ion transition, the retention time and the ion ratio of
the quantification and confirmation m/z ion transitions. Isotopically labeled
internal standards are used for precise and accurate quantification. This
method can be used to assess human exposure to select non-persistent
pesticides by measuring their metabolites in urine. It does not directly test
for any disease.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (â20Â°C) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS and Westat. Summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, are
reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciencesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary Pyrethroids, Herbicides, and OP Metabolites were measured
in a one third subsample of persons 6 years and over. Special sample weights
are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection.  
  
The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.  
  
The detection limit divided by the square root of 2 is the value that is
provided for results that are below the limit of detection.  
  
Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
