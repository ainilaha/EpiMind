### Osteoporosis (OSQ_D)

####  Data File: OSQ_D.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2008

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Osteoporosis section (OSQ) provides personal interview data on the
following:

  * Doctor told participant s/he had fractured hip, wrist, or spine 
  * Number of times hip, wrist, or spine was fractured 
  * Age at each hip, wrist, or spine fracture 
  * Amount of trauma causing each hip, wrist or spine fracture 
  * Whether the participant has ever been diagnosed as having osteoporosis 
  * If diagnosed with osteoporosis, whether the participant has been treated for it. 

In 2005, additional questions were added on:

  * Fractures of any other bones, amount of trauma causing the fractures, and age when the fractures occurred. 
  * Participant use of prednisone or cortisone pills 
  * Whether either of the participant's biological parents had ever been diagnosed as having osteoporosis 
  * Whether the participant's mother had ever fractured her hip, and if so, at what age 
  * Whether the participant's father had ever fractured his hip, and if so, at what age 

Several of the questions in this section also were included in the NHANES III:
1988-94 questionnaire under Musculoskeletal Conditions.

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for this section is participants 20 years and older.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

This questionnaire section was conducted in the home using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system

The Interviewer Procedure Manuals and Exam Manuals can be found on the NHANES
website.

The survey questionnaires can be found on the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of the file.

For details on the QA/QC process for this component, please refer to the
procedures manual on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

The maximum number of hip fractures reported was 3; the maximum number of
wrist fractures reported was 7; and the maximum number of spine fractures
reported was 10.

For participants age 85 years and older, responses to OSD030a (How old were
you when you fractured your hip?), OSD030b (how old were you when you
fractured your wrist?), OSD030c (How old were you when you fractured your
spine?), and OSQ110 (How old were you when you fractured (other bones) after
you were 20 years of age) were coded as 85 years. This was done to address
data disclosure concerns and to be consistent with age codes in the
demographic and other sample person files.

The following variables had empty fields and therefore were dropped from the
data file: OSQ030ad-aj, OSQ040ad-aj, OSQ050ad-aj, OSQ030bh-bj, OSQ040bh-bj,
OSQ050bh-bj.

## Analytic Notes

Since these data are collected during the household questionnaire, interview
weights should be used. Although these data were collected as part of the
household questionnaire, if they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam
sample weights should be used for the analyses.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website.
