# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 1999-2000 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Miscellaneous Pain (MPQ)

####  Data File: MPQ.xpt

##### First Published: June 2002

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Miscellaneous Pain section (variable name prefix MPQ), provides personal
interview data on several pain topics.

**Topics**

  * Joint Pain 
  * Pain regions in body 

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for questions in this section is individuals 20+ years of
age.

## Data Processing and Editing

**Data Processing and Preparation**

Please review the file codebook that accompanies the interview data file for a
listing of the regions of the body that were specifically mentioned during
data collection for MPQ.050. For the "other" category, data were combined into
a single count without information on location. For NHANES 2001 and beyond,
the "other" category will be eliminated. A QC/QA review of the NHANES
1999-2000 data showed that a majority of the "other" responses did not pertain
to joints and therefore were not valid responses for this question. In a small
number of instances, the "other" response could be back-coded to an existing
response category. For example, pain in knuckle on the left hand would be
coded to pain in the left fingers.

**Data Editing**

Responses to MPQ.040 (How many weeks or months, in the past year did you have
joint symptoms due to an injury?) will be recoded to a single time unit
(weeks).Ã‚
