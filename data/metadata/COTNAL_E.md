### Cotinine - Serum & Total NNAL - Urine (COTNAL_E)

####  Data File: COTNAL_E.xpt

#####  First Published: April 2010

#####  Last Revised: February 2012

## Component Description

The specific aims of the component are: 1) to measure the prevalence and
extent of tobacco use; 2) to estimate the extent of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), and determine trends in exposure to ETS; and 3) to
describe the relationship between tobacco use (as well as exposure to ETS) and
chronic health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

The tobacco component for NHANES will include questionnaire items on current
and past use of cigarettes, pipes, cigars and smokeless tobacco. Exposure to
ETS at home and at work and in-utero ETS exposure among children will also be
obtained. ETS exposure will also be assessed for examinees 3 years of age and
older, through the measurement of serum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine. In
addition, use of nicotine replacement products (e.g., gum and patch) will be
collected, using questionnaires.

The tobacco-specific nitrosamine NNK
(4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) is a significant component of
tobacco and tobacco smoke. In the smoker's body, NNK is rapidly reduced to its
metabolite, NNAL (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanonol). A
significant portion of NNAL may also exist in the glucuronide form NNAL-Gluc
(NNAL-N-Gluc and NNAL-O-Gluc) in the urine. Both NNK and NNAL are potent lung
carcinogens in rodents ( Smith C. J. and Hansch C. Food and Chemical
Toxicology), and they are likely involved in the increased lung cancer risk in
smokers ((Hecht S. S. and Hoffmann D., Carcinogenesis); (Hecht, Chem.
Res.Toxicol); (Preston-(Martin, S, IARC Sci. Publ.) The NNAL metabolite has
similar carcinogenicity to NNK (Hecht, S. S. Carcinogenesis,). NNAL (either
free and/or total forms) may be used as a biomarker for exposure to NNK among
active smokers, and also among nonsmokers following exposure to secondhand
smoke (SHS).

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 3 years and older for cotinine and aged 6 years and older
for total NNAL, who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria, are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Whole blood specimens and urine are processed, stored, and shipped to the
Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

Cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine that may be used as a marker for
both active smoking, and as an index to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS)
exposure, or "passive smoking". Cotinine is generally preferred over nicotine
for such assessments because of its substantially longer half-life. The half-
life of cotinine in plasma has been estimated to be about 15-20 hrs; by
contrast, the half-life of nicotine is only 0.5-3 hrs. Cotinine may be
measured in serum, urine or saliva - the half-life of cotinine in all three
fluids is essentially the same. Cotinine concentrations tend to be higher
(3-8x) in urine than in serum; however, for studies requiring a quantitative
assessment of exposure, plasma or serum is regarded as the fluid of choice.
Therefore, serum was chosen for NHANES cotinine analyses.

Serum cotinine is measured by an isotope dilution-high performance liquid
chromatography / atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (ID HPLC-APCI MS/MS). Briefly, the serum sample is spiked with
methyl-D3 cotinine as an internal standard, and after an equilibration period,
the sample is applied to a basified solid-phase extraction column. Cotinine is
extracted off the column with methylene chloride, the organic extract is
concentrated, and the residue is injected onto a short, C18 HPLC column. The
eluant from these injections is monitored by APCI-MS/MS, and the m/z 80
daughter ion from the m/z 177 quasi-molecular ion is quantitated, along with
additional ions for the internal standard, external standard, and for
confirmation. Cotinine concentrations are derived from the ratio of native to
labeled cotinine in the sample, by comparisons to a standard curve.

NNAL is measured by using liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass
spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). For "total" NNAL assays, the urine sample is
fortified with an NNAL-13C6 internal standard, and then hydrolyzed using
β-glucuronidase in incubations for at least 24 hours. The samples are then
extracted and cleaned up on a specially-designed solid-phase molecularly-
imprinted polymer (MIP) column, after which the analyte is eluted and analyzed
by LC/MS/MS, monitoring the m/z 210->180 native, and m/z 216->186 internal
standard transition ions. NNAL concentrations are derived from the ratio of
the integrated peaks of native to labeled ions by comparison to a standard
calibration curve. Free NNAL measurements are conducted in a similar manner,
but with the omission of prior enzymatic hydrolysis. Bound NNAL (i.e. NNAL-
Gluc) may be estimated from the difference of (Total NNAL - Free NNAL). This
method has been described previously ( Xia Y, McGuffey JE, Anal Chem.)

There were no changes to the equipment, lab method, or lab site from the
previous two years. Urinary total NNAL testing was adding in 2007-2008.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the General Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed
QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. The Household Questionnaire
Data Files also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
required to analyze these data. The Phlebotomy Examination file includes
auxiliary information on duration of fasting, the time of day of the
venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture. The Household
Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be linked to the laboratory data
file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

In cases, where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for
that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of two.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the Analytic
Guidelines for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues. The Analytic Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
