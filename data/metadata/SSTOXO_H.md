### Toxoplasma gondii Antibody - Serum (Surplus) (SSTOXO_H)

####  Data File: SSTOXO_H.xpt

##### First Published: April 2017

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at
serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

Sera from residual specimens from NHANES 2013-2014 participants were tested
for _Toxoplasma gondii_ by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that detects IgG and
IgM antibodies against _T. gondii_. The results for the Toxoplasma IgG in this
data release are reported as IU/ml. Samples with results ≥ 33 IU/mL should be
coded as Positive, samples with results < 27 IU/mL should be coded as
Negative, and samples with results ≥ 27 IU/mL and <33 IU/mL were considered
Equivocal. The Toxoplasma IgM results are reported as Ratio values. Sample
Ratio < 0.8 are coded as Negative, Sample Ratio ≥ 0.8 < 1 are coded as
Equivocal, and Sample Ratio ≥ 1 are coded Positive. All results originally
considered Equivocal were repeated at least twice for confirmation and should
be coded as Negative.

To complement the detection of anti-toxoplasma IgG and IgM the VIDAS Toxo-IgG
Avidity assay was performed on the samples that coded positive for both IgG
and IgM. Samples with results <20 are coded Low, samples ≥20 and <30 are coded
Equivocal, and samples ≥30 are coded High.

## Eligible Sample

Participants age 6+ who consented to storing their samples for future research
and had stored samples from 2013-2014. As required by the NCHS ERB, Toxoplasma
IgM testing was excluded for women pregnant at the time of the MEC examination
and within 1 year previously.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

 _Toxoplasma gondii_ IgG and IgM antibodies were measured with two enzyme
immunoassay kits (Bio-Rad, Redmond, WA). The Toxoplasma IgG EIA test utilizes
antigen-coated wells. The samples are incubated in the antigen-coated wells,
(if present) _T. gondii_ antibodies are immobilized in the wells. Residual
sample is eliminated by washing and conjugate (enzyme labeled antibodies to
human IgG) is added and incubated. If IgG antibodies to _T. gondii_ are
present, the conjugate will be immobilized in the wells. Residual conjugate is
eliminated by washing and the substrate is added. In the presence of the
enzyme, the substrate is converted to a yellow end product which is read
photometrically.

The Platelia Toxo IgM test utilizes an immunoenzymatic double sandwich method.
The samples are incubated in the anti-human IgM coated wells. The IgM
antibodies, if present, are captured by the solid phase. Remaining antibodies
and residual sample are removed by washing. A solution containing _T. gondii_
antigen and conjugate (monoclonal antibody to _T. gondii_ labeled with HRP) is
added to the wells. _T. gondii_ IgM antibodies in the sample that are captured
on the wells bind the _T. gondii_ antigen-complex. Excess _T. gondii_ antigen
and conjugate are removed by washing and the substrate is added. In the
presence of the enzyme, the substrate is converted to a yellow end product
which is read photometrically.

Optical density was determined on a vMax microplate reader and computer
equipped with SOFTmax software (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA).

Quality control samples are included on every plate. The results of serologic
tests are of value as presumptive evidence of _T. gondii_ infection. The test
results are objective and normalized as index values, International Units
(IU/mL), which are traceable to the WHO Anti-Toxoplasma Serum, 3rd
International Standard Preparation, 1994. Prior to the study the Toxoplasma
IgG EIA was evaluated using an established serum panel and comparison with the
CDC Toxoplasma immunofluorescence assay and the Sabin-Feldman dye test and
found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 100%.

The avidity test was performed on samples positive for both Toxoplasma IgG and
IgM by Palo Alto Medical Foundation utilizing the VIDAS® TOXO IgG Avidity
(TXGA) kit. The VIDAS® TOXO IgG Avidity assay is an automated qualitative test
for the determination of anti-Toxoplasma IgG avidity in human serum using the
ELFA technique (Enzyme Linked Fluorescent Assay). The assay is intended for
use in conjunction with results from the VIDAS TOXO IgG II and must have a
positive titer ≥ 8 IU/mL. Samples with an index (ratio of high avidity
antibodies to total IgG antibodies; numbers represent percent) of <20 are
coded as Low avidity, samples ≥20 but <30 are coded Equivocal, and samples ≥30
are coded High avidity.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The _Toxoplasma gondii_ EIA test is considered in control provided the quality
control serum is within two standard deviations of its mean.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data was compiled after all the antibody testing was completed. The data were
not edited.

Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Analytic Notes

Results were measured as IU/ml for Toxoplasma IgG. Samples with results ≥ 33
IU/mL should be coded as Positive, samples with results < 27 IU/mL should be
coded as Negative, and samples with results ≥ 27 IU/mL and <33 IU/mL were
considered Equivocal. All results originally considered Equivocal were
repeated at least twice for confirmation and should be coded as Negative.

Results were measured as Sample Ratio for Toxoplasma IgM. Sample Ratio < 0.8
are coded as Negative, Sample Ratio ≥ 0.8 < 1 are coded as Equivocal, and
Sample Ratio ≥ 1 are coded Positive. All results originally considered
Equivocal were repeated at least twice for confirmation and should be coded as
Negative. _Toxoplasma gondii_ IgM antibodies can persist for several months to
years after acute infection, and false-positive tests occur, therefore
Toxoplasma IgM tests have limited use in determining the timing or incidence
of _T. gondii_ infection.
