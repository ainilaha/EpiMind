### Consumer Behavior Phone Follow-up Module - Child (CBQPFC_J)

####  Data File: CBQPFC_J.xpt

##### First Published: June 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Consumer Behavior Phone Follow-up Module - Child (CBQPFC) section provides
interview data for participants 1-15 years old on various dietary related
consumer behavior topics at the family level. Topics included in the section
are:

  * Use of calorie labels on menus of various types of food-serving establishments (21 questions; CBQ506 - CBQ900); 
  * Use of certain components of the Nutrition Facts Label (17 questions; CBQ700 - CBQ695); and 
  * Respondent information (7 questions; CBQ755, DBQ930, DBQ935, DBQ940, DBQ945, CBQ760, and CBQ765). 

In 2007, a Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module was introduced in
NHANES. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic Research
Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was designed to
collect information on people's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward
nutrition and food choices.

The FCBS module has two elements: a core set of questions asked in the
household interview, and a supplementary module asked in a 15-minute telephone
follow-up interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data
collection cycle. While the core questions remained in the survey
continuously, the supplementary module was discontinued after 2009-2010 and
reinstituted in 2017-2018.

Data from the core set of questions in the 2017-2018 FCBS module have been
included in the Diet Behavior and Nutrition (DBQ), Consumer Behavior (CBQ),
Income (INQ), and Food Security (FSQ) sections and released in separate files
available on the [NHANES
website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2017).

The FCBS supplementary phone follow-up module was designed to be administered
differently depending upon the survey participant's age. For participants aged
16 years and older, we were interested in how their behavior related to their
own diet and health. Therefore, the data were collected at person-level,
meaning each participant answered the questions for himself/herself. For
children ages 1-15 years old, the research interest was to see how the adults'
beliefs and behaviors can be related to the intake of children in the family.
For example, the fast food buying habits of an adult may relate to the dietary
intake of the children in the same family. Therefore, the FCBS phone follow-up
data were collected at the family level for children 1-15 years old. The
questions were asked to one adult respondent in the family, the data were then
linked to all eligible children in the home. The adult was not providing a
proxy response for the child but giving his/her own information in this
interview.

To be consistent with the design of the instrument, data from the FCBS
supplementary phone follow up module are released in two separate files based
on the target groups: one dataset (CBQPFA_J) for survey participants 16 years
and older, and another dataset (CBQPFC_J) for participants 1-15 years old.

Similar to other datasets in the NHANES 2017-2018 release cycle, all FCBS
related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). For
more information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the documentations
accompanying the datasets.

## Eligible Sample

All NHANES participants aged 1 year and older who complete a dietary interview
in the mobile examination center (MEC) were eligible to participate in the
FCBS follow-up interview. However, only data collected for participants aged
1-15 years are included in this dataset. Data from survey participants aged 16
years and older are released in a separate dataset
([CBQPFA_J](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/cbqpfa_j.htm)).

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The FCBS follow-up interview was administered over the telephone after the day
2 dietary interview (Note: The day 2 dietary interviews were conducted by
telephone 3-10 days after the health examination in the MEC, but the timing
varied). After the day 2 dietary interview was completed for the first child
aged 1-15 years in the family, a set of screening questions was asked to
identify the family's meal planner and/or food shopper to be the respondent
for the FCBS follow-up interview.

All the questions were asked by trained interviewers using the Computer-
Assisted Telephone Interviewing - CATI system. A hand card booklet was given
to the participants before they left the MEC for them to use later during the
follow-up interview. When necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to
respondents.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CATI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CATI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data were reviewed by
NHANES office staff for accuracy and completeness.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some
variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of
the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure
concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing
process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e.,
CBQ) to a D (i.e., CBD). For example, some data were collected using two
variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable), but combined
into a single variable for data release purposes.

## Analytic Notes

Only participants who complete a day 1 dietary interview in the MEC are
eligible to participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. For the 2017-2018
NHANES, there were 2,045 children aged 1-15 years eligible for the FCBS
follow-up interview; of these, 1,665 were considered respondents for the FCBS.
Dietary day 1 sample weights (WTDRD1) are recommended for use in analysis with
data from the FCBS follow-up module (either alone or when the FCBS follow-up
data are used in conjunction with MEC data). This set of weights was
constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting
for (a) the additional non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day
of the week for the dietary intake data collection. For more detailed
information on the dietary day 1 weights, refer to the [documentation
accompanying the dietary
datasets](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/DR1TOT_J.htm).

The order of the response categories for five questions (CBQ915, CBQ925,
CBQ738, CBQ698, and CBQ695) were randomized by household to minimize primacy
and recency bias.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. Both are
available on the NHANES website.
