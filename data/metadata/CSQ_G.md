### Taste & Smell (CSQ_G)

####  Data File: CSQ_G.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Taste & Smell Questionnaire Section (variable name prefix CSQ) collected
interview data on taste and smell ability and related health conditions. The
senses of taste and smell mediate all the body's food intake. These two senses
work together to provide food flavor perception and palatability. Self-
reported data on taste and smell may therefore be relevant to the analysis of
NHANES nutritional, blood pressure, obesity, and health measures data. Also,
the CSQ questionnaire was designed to provide data to support the Healthy
People 2020 objectives for taste and smell disorders (Healthy People, 2020).

In the healthy normal population, genetic and functional variation in taste
and smell ability may help explain part of individual differences in food
preferences and consumption. This could assist in our understanding of diet-
related health conditions. There are also age-related changes in smell and
flavor perception that may affect food palatability and nutrient intake.
Metabolic rate and energy intake are known to decrease with age, so food
selection in older persons can be important for maintaining nutrition and
energy balance. With age, some persons may consume more in response to a
reduced ability to smell, while others may consume less.

Prior national-level U.S. data on taste and smell includes the 1994 National
Health Interview Survey- Disability Supplement (NHIS, 1994), a population-
based questionnaire survey which estimated that among U.S. adults, there was a
1.4% prevalence of chronic smell problems and a 0.6% prevalence of chronic
taste problems. With combined data, 1.65% of adults reported either a chronic
smell or a chronic taste problem. In the survey, prevalence rates increased
exponentially with age and almost 40% of those with a self-reported smell or
taste problem were 65 years of age or older (Hoffman et al., 1998). Another
national level questionnaire survey of olfactory dysfunction has recently been
reported (Lee et al, 2013).

The NHANES 2011-12 household interview taste and smell questionnaire collected
data on self-reported taste and smell ability, selected symptoms of and
medical treatment for taste and smell disorders, and data on conditions that
may represent risk factors for taste and smell disorders. These questionnaire
items may be helpful to describe self-reported variation in taste and smell
ability, and to estimate the prevalence of self-reported medical provider
diagnosed smell and taste disorders among U.S. adults.

## Eligible Sample

Adults of both genders ages 40+ years were eligible to participate. There were
no exclusions for the CSQ taste & smell questionnaire.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The 2011-12 NHANES taste and smell questionnaire data was verified against the
main data collection file prior to public release.

## Analytic Notes

These data were collected as a part of the NHANES Household Questionnaire
Interview. For data analysis, NHANES Household Interview weights should be
used if only questionnaire data is being studied. However, if CSQ
questionnaire data is merged with MEC examination or laboratory data, then
NHANES MEC examination weights should be used for the analyses (or if
applicable, subsample laboratory weights). Please refer to the NHANES Analytic
Guidelines and the on-line NHANES Tutorial for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.

The CSQ questionnaire was specially developed for NHANES use and had not been
previously used elsewhere. Despite prior cognitive testing of the instrument,
when the CSQ questionnaire was fielded, one question did not perform as
intended. CSQ030 was intended to capture a history of an altered, typically
unpleasant perception of smell in the presence of an ordinary odor (parosmia).
In the field most participants who answered "yes" to this question did not
believe that they had any problem with their ability to smell. However, CSQ030
was retained in the public data release because of the possibility that it
might have some analytic use where there was other questionnaire or
examination data to suggest an abnormality of smell.

Decreased taste and smell ability may be transient (for example, from a recent
temporary illness) or chronic. The variable CSQ070 captures this dimension for
abnormalities of smell. Duration of taste or smell symptoms is captured by the
variables CSQ140 and CSQ060, respectively. Taste and smell ability may be
adversely affected by a number of chronic health conditions and by the side
effects of prescription medications. A recently published community study
indicates that smoking may also adversely affect the ability to smell and
taste (Vennemann et al., 2008).

A number of NHANES 2011-12 datasets may be pertinent to the analysis of taste
and smell data. These include NHANES datasets on medical conditions (MCQ, KIQ,
DIQ, BPQ); blood sugar (BIOPRO, GHB); blood pressure (BPX); body weight (BMQ,
WHQ); diet and nutrition (DTQ, DRXDOC, DSQDOC, DBQ); smoking (SMQ, COTNAL);
osteoporosis (OSQ, DXX); oral health (OHXDEN, OHXPER); and prescription
medication use (RXQ_RX).

The variables CSQ200 through CSQ260 identify a history of some co-morbid
conditions not captured in other NHANES questionnaires that could potentially
affect taste and smell. These include the history of a recent prolonged head
cold or flu; persistent dry mouth; chronic nasal congestion resulting from
allergies; recurrent sinusitis, a history of tonsillectomy or of wisdom teeth
extraction; and loss of consciousness or nasal fracture due to head injury.
Also the AUQ_G Household Interview Audiometry questionnaire collected 2
additional questions: a history of repeated ear infections (AUQ136) and a
history of ear tube placement (AUQ138).
