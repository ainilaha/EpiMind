### Osteoporosis (OSQ_F)

####  Data File: OSQ_F.xpt

#####  First Published: January 2012

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Osteoporosis section (OSQ) provides personal interview data on the
following:

  * Doctor told participant s/he had fractured hip, wrist, or spine 
  * Number of times hip, wrist, or spine was fractured 
  * Age at each hip, wrist, or spine fracture 
  * Amount of trauma causing each hip, wrist or spine fracture 
  * Fractures of any other bones, amount of trauma causing the fractures, and age when the fractures occurred 
  * Whether the participant has ever been diagnosed as having osteoporosis 
  * If diagnosed with osteoporosis, whether the participant has been treated for it. 
  * Participant use of prednisone or cortisone pills 
  * Whether either of the participant's biological parents had ever been diagnosed as having osteoporosis 
  * Whether the participant's mother had ever fractured her hip, and if so, at what age 
  * Whether the participant's father had ever fractured his hip, and if so, at what age 

Several of the questions in this section also were included in the NHANES III:
1988-94 questionnaire under Musculoskeletal Conditions.

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for this section is participants 20 years and older.
However, the target sample for some questions in this section is participants
50 years and older. Please review the codebook carefully.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked in the home by trained interviewers using a
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. Hand cards showing
response categories were used for some questions.

The 2009-2010 Interviewer Procedure Manuals and Exam Manuals and the
Osteoporosis Sample Person Questionnaire can be found on the [NHANES
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of the file.

For details on the quality control/quality assurance process for this
component, please refer to the NHANES 2009-2010 Interviewer Procedure Manuals
on the [NHANES website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Data Processing and Editing

For participants age 80 years and older, responses to OSD030a (How old were
you when you fractured your hip?), OSD030b (how old were you when you
fractured your wrist?), OSD030c (How old were you when you fractured your
spine?), and OSQ110 (How old were you when you fractured (other bones) after
you were 20 years of age) were coded as 80 years. This was done to address
data disclosure concerns and to be consistent with age codes in the
demographic and other sample person files.

The following variables had empty fields and were dropped from the data file:
OSD030AC-OSD030AJ, OSD030CD-OSD030CJ, OSD050AC-OSD050AJ, OSD050CD-OSD050CJ,
OSD050BE-OSD050BG, OSD050CF, OSD110G-OSD110J, OSQ040AB-OSQ040AJ, OSQ040CD-
OSQ040CJ, OSQ100G-OSQ100J.

## Analytic Notes

Since these data are collected during the household questionnaire, interview
weights should be used. However, if these data are merged with MEC exam data,
exam sample weights should be used for the analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
