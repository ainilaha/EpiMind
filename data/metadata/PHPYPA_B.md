### Phthalates, Phytoestrogens & PAHs - Urine (PHPYPA_B)

####  Data File: PHPYPA_B.xpt

#####  First Published: May 2005

#####  Last Revised: January 2012

## Component Description

**Urinary Phthalates**

Phthalate acid esters (phthalates) are used extensively as plasticizers in a
wide range of applications such as children's toys, food packaging, and
medical supplies. Because some of these compounds are known to be estrogenic
and have been associated with a host of health problems in rats, such as
cancers and teratogenicity, governments in Europe and Japan have become
increasingly concerned about levels in food packaging materials and children's
toys. Biomeasures of phthalates in humans are necessary to evaluate potential
human health threats from exposure to these chemicals.

**Urinary Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**

PAHs constitute a group of chemicals, which are formed during the incomplete
combustion of coal, oil and gas, garbage, and other organic substances. These
compounds require metabolic activation prior to their interactions with
cellular macromolecules. PAHs are ubiquitous; thus, exposure to them is
widespread. In general, people are exposed to mixtures of PAHs, the sources of
which include vehicle exhausts, asphalt roads, coal, coal tar, wild fires,
agricultural burning, charbroiled foods, and hazardous waste sites. Although
most of the data regarding the carcinogenicity of these compounds comes from
rats and mice, epidemiologic studies have shown increased mortality due to
lung and bladder cancer in humans exposed to coke-oven emissions, roofing-tar
emissions, and cigarette smoke. PAHs enter the body quickly and easily by all
routes of exposure and are readily and predominantly metabolized to
hydroxylated metabolites as well as glucuronide metabolites. These metabolites
are excellent indicators of exposure to the parent PAHs. Although background
level ranges of PAHs in air and water are known, the equivalent metabolite
background levels in humans are not known. Because of increased epidemiologic
data relating PAH exposure to cancer incidence, biomonitoring PAH metabolites
in humans is very important.

**Urinary Phytoestrogens**

Many different plants produce compounds called phytoestrogens that mimic or
interact with estrogen. The major classes of phytoestrogens are lignans
(present in flaxseed, carrots, berries, and grapes) and isoflavones (present
in soybeans and other legumes). Biomeasures of phytoestrogens are necessary to
establish reference ranges for these compounds and to evaluate their potential
effects on human health.

## Eligible Sample

A one-third subsample of participants aged 6 years and older.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Urinary Phthalates: Mono-Ethyl Phthalate, Mono-n-Butyl Phthalate, Mono-
Cyclohexyl Phthalate, Mono- (2-Ethyl) Hexyl Phthalate, Mono-n-Octyl Phthalate,
Mono-Benzyl Phthalate, and Mono-Isononyl Phthalate**

Human urine samples were processed using enzymatic deconjugation of the
glucuronides followed by solid-phase extraction. The eluate was concentrated,
and the phthalate metabolites chromatographically resolved by reversed-phase
HPLC, detected by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass
spectrometry (APCI-MS/MS), and quantified by isotope dilution. Assay precision
was improved by incorporating 13C4-labeled internal standards for each of the
seven analytes, as well as a conjugated internal standard to monitor
deconjugation efficiency. This selective method allows for rapid detection of
seven metabolites of commonly used dialkyl phthalates in human urine with
limits of detection in the low parts per billion (ppb) range.

**Urinary Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**

This method is used to assess human exposure to selected PAHs, a class of
potential human carcinogens, by determining the concentrations of their mono-
hydroxy metabolites in urine. Common routes of occupational exposure to PAHs
may include work involving diesel fuels and coal tars through paving and
roofing. Possible environmental exposures may include smoking, dietary, smog
and forest fires. Threshold levels for carcinogenicity have not been
determined for most PAHs. Application of this method to the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) project will help determine the
concentration range of these chemicals in residents in the United States.

The specific analytes measured in this method are monohydroxy-polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (OH-PAH). The procedure involves enzymatic hydrolysis of
urine (to hydrolyze PAH conjugates), solid-phase extraction, derivatization,
and analysis using capillary gas chromatography combined with high-resolution
mass spectrometry (GC/HRMS). This method uses isotope dilution with
13C-labeled internal standards. Ions from each analyte and each 13C-labeled
internal standard are monitored, and the abundances of each ion are measured.
The ratios of these ions are used as criteria for evaluating the data. By
evaluating the concentrations of these analytes in urine, an assessment of
human exposure to the respective PAH can be obtained.

**Urinary Phytoestrogens: Daidzein, Genistein, Equol, O-Desmethylangolensin,
Coumestrol, Matairesinol, Enterodiol, and Enterolactone**

Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that can effect in vivo estrogen signaling.
These "plant estrogens" have been shown to affect the human endocrine system
and thus may affect human health. Consumption of foods rich in phytoestrogens
is associated with many positive health outcomes: reduced risk for cancer and
heart disease, reduction of menopausal symptoms and modulation of
osteoporosis. The potential of these compounds to impact human health has led
to the need for rapid, sensitive, and precise assays for phytoestrogen
metabolites in physiological matrices. Previous methods for phytoestrogen
quantitation used less selective and/or less sensitive techniques. Many
laboratories use HPLC coupled with UV detection (Obermeyer et al., 1995;
Franke et al., 1994) due to its low cost, although these methods lack
selectivity and sensitivity. A novel approach using HPLC with coulometric
array detection (Gamache et al., 1998) shows promise for increased selectivity
and sensitivity, but selectivity depends greatly on redox potential, resulting
in inadequate sensitivity for some important phytoestrogens in complex
matrices such as serum. The application of capillary electrophoresis-tandem
mass spectrometry to the detection of phytoestrogens shows promise of improved
sensitivity and specificity, but this technique has yet to be fully utilized
due to difficulties in handling very small sample volumes. GC-MS methods
provide needed selectivity and sensitivity for the analysis of phytoestrogens
in biological matrices (Joannou, et al., 1995; Messina et al., 1997) but
require cumbersome derivatization steps for these nonvolatile compounds. HPLC-
MS does not require derivatization, and therefore results in much higher
throughput. Barnes et al. (1998) developed an HPLC-MS/MS method for the
detection of phytoestrogens in serum and urine; however, the method did not
chromatographically resolve all of the major phytoestrogens and included only
one internal standard.

Here we present an HPLC-MS/MS method that builds on the work by Barnes et al.
(1998) to result in a method with improved selectivity, sensitivity, and
precision for the quantitative detection of phytoestrogens in human urine and
serum. The method uses enzymatic deconjugation of the phytoestrogens followed
by solid-phase extraction and reverse-phase HPLC to resolve the analytes. The
phytoestrogens are detected using a Sciex API III heated nebulizer-atmospheric
pressure chemical ionization (HN-APCI) interface coupled with MS/MS. This
method allows for rapid detection of the major isoflavones and lignans in
human serum and urine with limits of detection in the low ppb range.
Selectivity of the method is insured by the combination of tandem mass
spectrometry and chromatographic resolution. Internal standards for each of
the analytes improved the precision of the assay.

## Data Processing and Editing

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES
1999. In the mobile examination centers (MECs) and analytical laboratories,
data for the laboratory component is recorded directly onto a computerized
data collection form. The system is centrally integrated and it allows for
ongoing monitoring of much of the data. While the complete blood count and
pregnancy analyses are performed in the MEC laboratory, most analyses are
conducted elsewhere by approximately 21 laboratories across the United States.

Guidelines are developed that provided standards for naming variables, filling
missing values, and handling missing records. NCHS staff, assisted by contract
staff, develops data editing specifications that check data sets for valid
codes, ranges, and skip pattern consistencies and examine the consistency of
values between interrelated variables. Comments are reviewed and recoded. NCHS
staff verifies extremely high and low values whenever possible, and numerous
consistency checks are performed. Nonetheless, users should examine the range
and frequency of values before analyzing data.

For laboratory tests with a lower detection limit, results below the lower
detection limit are replaced with a value equal to the detection limit divided
by the square root of two. This value is created to help the user distinguish
a nondetectable laboratory test result from a measured laboratory test result.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

## Analytic Notes

Measures of urinary phthalates, urinary polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and urinary
phytoestrogens are assessed in participants aged 6 years and over on a one-
third sample. Use the special weights included in this data file when
analyzing data. Read the "Special Sample Weights for this Dataset" information
provided below before beginning analysis.

Mono-ethyl phthalate (URXMEP), Mono-benzyl phthalate (URXMZP), Mono-n-octyl
phthalate (URXMOP), Mono-isononyl phthalate (URXMNP), and Mono-cyclohexyl
phthalate (URXMCP):  
NHANES recently learned that analytical standards used since 1999 and used for
several metabolites were of insufficient purity. As a result of further
investigation, a correction factor was applied to each value for the 5
metabolites.

**Detection limits**

For all analytes in this data set, the detection limit was constant. In cases
where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that variable
is the detection limit divided by the square root of two.  
The analysis of NHANES 2001-2002 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2001-2002
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Household Questionnaire and other data files may be linked to
the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Special Sample Weights for this Dataset**

Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Measures
of this urinary multi-analyte profile are assessed in participants aged 6
years and over on a randomly selected 1/3 subsample. Specific sample weights
for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data.

The dataset includes 2-year and 4-year subsample weights. The 4-year weights
should be used if these 2001-2002 data are combined with 1999-2000 data. The
1999-2000 data files have been updated to include the subsample 4-year
weights. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively), which are
included in the demographic data file for each data release. For further
information, see the NHANES Analytic Guidelines, June 2004 version at:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_general_guidelines_june_04.pdf>.
