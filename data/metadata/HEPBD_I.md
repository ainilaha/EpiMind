## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. Co-infection with hepatitis D virus (HDV) in persons with
acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to fulminant
hepatitis. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate the
spread of HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the United States.
Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and control of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic
infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of these
diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally
representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide the most
reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will
be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years or older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)**

The VITROS Anti-HBc assay is performed using the VITROS Anti-HBc Reagent Pack
and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HBc Calibrator on the VITROS
ECi/ECiQ or VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.

A competitive immunoassay technique is used. This involves the reaction of
anti-HBc in the sample with hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) coated wells.
Unbound sample is removed by washing. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled
antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-HBc) is then allowed to react with
the remaining exposed HBcAg on the well surface. Unbound conjugate is removed
by washing.  
  
The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent
containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt)
and an electron transfer agent is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound
conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light.
The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of
light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the
system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is indicative of the concentration
of anti HBc present.

**Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**

The VITROS HBsAg test is performed using the VITROS HBsAg Reagent Pack and
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products HBsAg Calibrator on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic Systems and the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. An
immunometric immunoassay technique is used, which involves the simultaneous
reaction of HBsAg in the sample with mouse monoclonal anti-HBs antibody coated
onto the wells and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse monoclonal
anti-HBs antibody in the conjugate. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing.

The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent
containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt)
and an electron transfer agent is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound
conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light.
The electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of
light produced and prolongs its emission. The light signals are read by the
system. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is indicative of the level of HBsAg
present in the sample.

**Hepatitis D antibody (anti-HDV)**  
  
The method for qualitative anti-HD determination is a simultaneous competitive
assay. Anti-HD present in the sample and labeled anti-HD antibodies complete
for a fixed quantity of HDAg bound to the solid phase. The quantity of enzyme
tracer bound to the solid phase and consequently the enzyme activity are
inversely proportional to the anti-HD concentration present in samples or
controls.  
  
Enzyme activity is measured by adding a colorless chromogen/substrate
solution. The enzyme action on the chromogen/substrate produces a color which
is measured with a photometer.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral
Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**The age range and constraints for Hepatitis B and D testing are as
follows:**

**Hepatitis B**

The hepatitis B core antibody test is performed on all examined participants
aged 6 years and older while the hepatitis B surface antibody test is
performed on all examined participants aged 2 years old and older. The
Hepatitis B surface antigen is tested only when the Hepatitis B core antibody
test is positive. Participant results are coded positive for surface antigen
if the surface antigen test is positive; they are coded negative for surface
antigen if the test for surface antigen is negative or if the test for
hepatitis B core antibody is negative.

**Hepatitis D**

The Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is a RNA defective virus; and an infection
with HDV only occurs in the presence of acute or chronic HBV infection. In
NHANES, the test for antibody to HDV is performed on all examined participants
6 years and older who test positive for anti-HBc and HBsAg. The denominator
for anti-HDV includes all anti-HBc negative samples, the anti-HBc positive
samples that were subsequently found to be HBsAg negative, and the samples
that were anti-HBc positive and HBsAg positive that were subsequently found to
be anti-HDV negative.  

**Detection Limits**

This data is qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
