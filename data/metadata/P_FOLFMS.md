### Folate Forms - Total & Individual - Serum (P_FOLFMS)

####  Data File: P_FOLFMS.xpt

##### First Published: December 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

The objectives of this component are to: 1) provide data for monitoring
secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2)
evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors, such as physical
activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on
nutritional status; and 3) evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and
public health policies, including welfare reform legislation, food
fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status
of the U.S. population.  
  
These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroup, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used in research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

All examined female participants aged 12-49 years, and other examined
participants (all males as well as females 1-11 years and 50+ years) one year
and older from a one-half subsample in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Five folate forms, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, folic acid, tetrahydrofolate,
5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, and an oxidation
product of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate called MeFox (pyrazino-s-triazine
derivative of 4-α-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofolate) are measured by isotope-
dilution high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Fazili, et al. 2013). The assay is performed by
combining specimen (150 µL serum) with an ammonium formate buffer and an
internal standard mixture. Sample extraction and clean-up is performed by
automated 96-probe solid phase extraction (SPE) using 96-well phenyl SPE
plates and takes ~1 h for a 96-well plate. Folate forms are separated within 6
min using isocratic mobile phase conditions and measured by LC-MS/MS.
Quantitation is based on peak area ratios interpolated against a five-point
aqueous linear calibration curve using 1/x2 weighting.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description on the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and [2019-2020 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals
(LPMs)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf). Vials are stored under appropriate
frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center for
Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured QA evaluation during unscheduled visits
to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC procedures.
Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation, specimen
collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive feedback are
given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are conducted annually
to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

One variable was created in this data file. The variable (LBDFOT) was created
using the following formula:

**LBDFOT:** The serum folate value in nmol/L (LBDFOTSI) was converted to ng/mL
(LBDFOT) by dividing LBDFOTSI by 2.265 (rounded to 3 significant figures).

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview
documents](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020 approximately 76%
of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Serum Folate Forms for NHANES 2017 - March 2020 **

In NHANES 2017-March 2020, a comprehensive list of serum folate forms was
measured by isotope-dilution high performance liquid chromatography coupled to
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (Table 1). Serum total folate (LBDFOTSI)
was calculated by adding LBXSF1SI-LBXSF5SI. LBXSF6SI was not included in the
total folate calculation, due to evidence that it may already be present in
vivo (Pfeiffer, et al. 2015). An imputed value of LOD divided by the square
root of 2 was used for individual folate forms with results that were < LOD.

Please refer to the Analytic Notes for the 2011-2012 Folate Forms - Serum
([FOLFMS_G](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/FOLFMS_G.htm)) file for
additional details on the comparability in serum total folate and folate forms
measured between NHANES 2011- March 2020 and the previous survey cycles.

**Table 1.**   Folate forms measured by LC-MS/MS

**Analyte** |  **Abbreviation** |  **Variable Name**  
---|---|---  
5-Methyltetrahydrofolate |  5-methylTHF |  LBXSF1SI  
Pteroylglutamic acid (Folic Acid) |  Folic acid |  LBXSF2SI  
5-Formyltetrahydrofolate |  5-formylTHF |  LBXSF3SI  
Tetrahydrofolate |  THF |  LBXSF4SI  
5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate |  5,10-methenylTHF |  LBXSF5SI  
Pyrazino-_s_ -triazine derivative of 4-α-hydroxy-5-methyltetrahydrofolate |  MeFox |  LBXSF6SI  
Serum total folate (sum of folate forms) |  tFOL |  LBDFOTSI  
  
**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined female
participants aged 12-49 years, and in a one-half subsample of other examined
participants one year and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Variable (WTFOLPRP) encoding of the specific
sample weights for this subsample is included in this data file and should be
used when analyzing these data. These special sample weights were created to
account for the subsample selection probability, as well as the additional
nonresponse to these lab tests. Therefore, if participants were eligible for
the subsample, but did not provide a blood specimen, they would have the
sample weight value assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017- March 2020
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDSF1LC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXSF1SI) provides the
analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the
lower limit of detection (ex., LBDSF1LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed
in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection
divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in nmol/L) for the 6 folate forms are
shown below. Because total folate is calculated from the sum of folate forms,
a lower limit of detection does not apply.

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXSF1SI |  5-Methyltetrahydrofolate |  0.13  
LBXSF2SI |  Folic acid |  0.14  
LBXSF3SI |  5-Formyltetrahydrofolate |  0.20  
LBXSF4SI |  Tetrahydrofolate |  0.25  
LBXSF5SI |  5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate |  0.20  
LBXSF6SI |  MeFox  |  0.10  
LBDFOTSI |  Total folate, serum |  n/a
