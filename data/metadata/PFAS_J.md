### Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS_J)

####  Data File: PFAS_J.xpt

##### First Published: November 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used in multiple
commercial applications including surfactants, lubricants, paints, polishes,
food packaging and fire-retarding foams. Certain PFAS are used in the
manufacture of polymers used in many industrial and consumer products,
including soil, stain, grease, and water resistant coatings on textiles and
carpet; uses in the automotive, mechanical, aerospace, chemical, electrical,
medical, and building/construction industries; personal care products; and
non-stick coatings on cookware. Some PFASs are ubiquitous contaminants found
in humans and animals worldwide.

Synthesis of PFAS employed electrochemical fluorination (ECF) or
fluorotelomerization. ECF, used from the 1950s until the early 2000s, yielded
branched and linear isomers. By contrast, fluorotelomerization produces almost
exclusively linear compounds (Vyas, et al. 2007). The structural isomer
patterns of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in
humans may be useful for understanding routes and sources of exposure
(Benskin, et al. 2010). Therefore, concentrations of linear PFOA (n-PFOA), sum
of branched isomers of PFOA (Sb-PFOA, branched PFOA isomers), linear PFOS
(n-PFOS), and sum of perfluoromethylheptane sulfonate isomers (Sm-PFOS,
monomethyl branched PFOS isomers) were measured in serum.

The calculated sum of isomers in the PFAS (formerly PFC) dataset for the
2017-2018 cycle is comparable to the total levels reported in previous cycles
of NHANES.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Online solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid
chromatography-turboionspray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE-
HPLC-TIS-MS/MS) is used for the quantitative detection of PFAS: 2-(N-methyl-
perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetate (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),  perfluorohexane
sulfonate (PFHxS), n-perfluorooctane sulfonate (n-PFOS), sum of
perfluoromethylheptane sulfonate isomers (Sm-PFOS, monomethyl branched isomers
of PFOS), n-perfluorooctanoate (n-PFOA), sum of branched perfluorooctanoate
isomers (Sb-PFOA, branched PFOA isomers), perfluorononanoate (PFNA),
perfluorodecanoate (PFDeA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUA), and
perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA)21. Briefly, after dilution with formic acid, one
aliquot of 50 μL of serum is injected into a commercial column switching
system allowing for concentration of the analytes on solid-phase extraction
column. Separation of the analytes from each other and from other serum
components is achieved with high-performance liquid chromatography. Detection
and quantification are done using negative-ion TurboIonSpray ionization, a
variant of electrospray ionization, tandem mass spectrometry. This method
allows for rapid detection of these PFAS in human serum with limits of
detection in the low parts per billion (ppb or ng/mL) range.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/PFAS-J-
MET-508.pdf) (January 2021)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for details
on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample weights**

Serum PFAS were measured in a one-third subsample of persons 12 years and
over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

Additional PFAS were measured as part of a surplus sera project among NHANES
2017-2018 survey participants 12 years and older. The data are to be released
in a separate file, SSPFAS_J and made available on the NHANES website as well.
****

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-2018 Demographic
Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "L" (ex., LBDPFHSL) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
LBDPFHSL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt(2)). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXPFHS) provides the
analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for each PFAS:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**

LBXBFOA |  Branch perfluorooctanoic acid isomers (Sb-PFOA) (ng/mL) |  0.10  
LBXNFOS |  n-perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (n-PFOS) (ng/mL) |  0.10  
LBXMFOS |  Perfluoromethylheptane sulfonic acid isomers (Sm-PFOS) (ng/mL) |  0.10
