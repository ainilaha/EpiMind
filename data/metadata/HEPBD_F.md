## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. Co-infection with hepatitis D virus (HDV) in persons with
acute or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to fulminant
hepatitis. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate the
spread of  HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the United States.
Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and control of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic
infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of these
diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally
representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide the most
reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will
be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 6 years or older are eligible to be tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for  HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Detailed specimen
collection and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

**Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)**

The VITROS Anti-HBc assay is performed using the VITROS Anti-HBc Reagent Pack
and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HBc Calibrator on the VITROS
ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic System.

A competitive immunoassay technique is used. This involves the reaction of
anti-HBc in the sample with hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) coated wells.
Unbound sample is removed by washing. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled
antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-HBc) is then allowed to react with
the remaining exposed HBcAg on the well surface. Unbound conjugate is removed
by washing.  
  
The bound HRP conjugate is measured by a luminescent reaction. A reagent
containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt)
and an electron transfer agent is added to the wells. The HRP in the bound
conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative, producing light.
The electron transfer agent increases the level and duration of the light
produced. The light signals are read by the VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic
System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is indicative of the concentration
of anti-HBc present in the sample.

**Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**

The VITROS HBsAg assay is performed using the VITROS HBsAg Reagent Pack and
VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products HBsAg Calibrator on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic System.

 An immunometric technique is used. This involves the simultaneous reaction of
HBsAg in the sample with mouse monoclonal anti-HBs antibody coated onto the
wells and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-HBs
antibody in the conjugate. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing.  
  
A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a
peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent is added to the wells. The HRP in
the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative,
producing light. The electron transfer agent increases the level and duration
of the light produced. The light signals are read by the VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is indicative of
the level of HBsAg present in the sample.

**Hepatitis D antibody (anti-HDV)  
  
**The DiaSorin ETI-AB-DELTAK-2 enzyme immunoassay used for qualitative anti-
HDV determination is a simultaneous competitive assay. Anti-HDV present in the
sample and labeled anti-HDV antibodies compete for a fixed quantity of HDAg
bound to the solid phase. The quantity of enzyme tracer bound to the solid
phase and consequently the enzyme activity are inversely proportional to the
anti-HDV concentration present in samples or controls.  
  
Enzyme activity is measured by adding a colorless chromogen/substrate
solution. The enzyme action on the chromogen/substrate produces a color which
is measured with a photometer.  
  
There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.  
  

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
file for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical
methods are described in the Description of Laboratory Methodology section
above.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the [General
Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
file for detailed QA/QC protocols. A detailed description of the [quality
assurance and quality control
procedures](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf)
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. The analysis of NHANES
laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey design and basic
demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire Data Files contain
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and
sample weights for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary
information such as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household
questionnaire and phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file
using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

The age range and constraints for hepatitis B and D testing are as follows:

**Hep B**

The hepatitis B core antibody test is performed on all examinees 6 years old
or older while the hepatitis B surface antibody test is performed on all
examinees 2 years old or older. The Hepatitis B surface antigen is tested only
when the Hepatitis B core antibody test is positive. Participant results are
coded positive for surface antigen if the surface antigen test is positive;
they are coded negative for surface antigen if the test for surface antigen is
negative or if the test for hepatitis B core antibody is negative.

**Hep D**

The Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is a RNA defective virus and infection with
HDV only occurs in the presence of acute or chronic HBV infection. In NHANES,
the test for antibody to HDV is performed on participants 6 years of age or
older who test positive for anti-HBc and HBsAg. The denominator for anti-HDV
includes all anti-HBc negative samples, the anti-HBc positive samples that
were subsequently found to be HBsAg negative, and the samples that were anti-
HBc positive and HBsAg positive that were subsequently found to be anti-HDV
negative.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
