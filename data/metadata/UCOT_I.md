### Cotinine, Hydroxycotinine, & Other Nicotine Metabolites and Analogs -
Urine (UCOT_I)

####  Data File: UCOT_I.xpt

##### First Published: September 2019

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The specific aims of the component are: 1) to measure the prevalence and
extent of tobacco use; 2) to estimate the extent of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), and determine trends in exposure to ETS; and 3) to
describe the relationship between tobacco use (as well as exposure to ETS) and
chronic health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Nicotine is the primary tobacco-specific alkaloid in tobacco plants and
tobacco smoke. Although, nicotine is not a direct cause of most diseases
associated with tobacco use, it is highly addictive, which can lead to tobacco
product dependence and chronic exposure to the carcinogens and bioactive
compounds in tobacco. The presence of nicotine in biological specimens
indicates exposure to tobacco, either through the active use of tobacco, or
from passive exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS). Trans-3'-hydroxycotinine and
cotinine are the two predominant nicotine metabolites in urine. Because their
concentrations are greater and their elimination half-lives are longer, these
metabolites are generally preferred over nicotine itself as exposure
biomarkers. The concentration ratio of hydroxycotinine to cotinine has been
used as an index of cytochrome P-450 2A6 activity. The relative concentration
of nicotine to its six major metabolites (trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, cotinine,
cotinine-N-oxide, nicotine-N-oxide, nornicotine, and
1-(3-Pyridyl)-1-butanol-4-carboxylic acid) is of interest when elucidating
differences in metabolic profiles of various ethnic, age, and gender groups
(James E. McGuffey, 2013). Furthermore, the sum of these metabolites may more
accurately describe the exposure of individuals and groups to tobacco products
compared to the most commonly used biomarker, urinary cotinine. Lastly,
anatabine and anabasine are nicotine analogs in tobacco product, and are
precursors for nitrosamines. Therefore, levels of these two compounds have
been used in monitoring compliance of smoking cessation programs as well as in
biomonitoring for nitrosamine-related studies.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible, and participants
aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

"Total" urinary nicotine metabolites, including the free and the glucuronide
conjugated forms, are measured by two separate isotope dilution high-
performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC-MS/MS)
methods based on the cotinine cutoff value of 20 ng/mL so that the markedly
different levels of nicotine exposure biomarkers can be optimally quantified
in both users and non-users. For samples with cotinine levels above or equal
to 20 ng/mL, the "Nicotine Metabolites and Analogs in Urine" method (Urinary
Nicotine Metabolites and Analogs Laboratory Procedure Manual) was applied, and
nicotine, its six metabolites (cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, nicotine-N-
oxide, cotinine-N-oxide, nornicotine, and 1-(3-Pyridyl)-1-butanol-4-carboxylic
acid), anatabine, and anabasine were measured. Briefly, a 100 µL urine sample
is spiked with a labeled internal standard mixture and incubated with beta-
glucuronidase to hydrolyze the conjugated analytes. Following the incubation
period, proteins and salts in the sample are precipitated with cold acetone.
The sample is centrifuged and part of the supernatant is transferred and
evaporated to remove acetone. The sample is further diluted approximately
5-fold prior to analysis on a HPLC-MS/MS system using electrospray ionization.
Chromatography is performed using a C18 analytical column; mass spectrometric
analysis is carried out under positive mode using scheduled multiple reaction
monitoring. One quantitation transition, one confirmation transition, and one
corresponding internal standard transition are monitored for each of the nine
analytes.

For samples with cotinine levels less than 20 ng/mL, the "Cotinine and
Hydroxycotinine in Urine" method (Urinary Cotinine and Hydroxycotinine
Laboratory Procedure Manual) was applied to measure only the cotinine and
trans-3'-hydroxycotinine levels. Briefly, a 200 uL urine sample is spiked with
labeled internal standard mixture and incubated with beta-glucuronidase to
hydrolyze the conjugated analytes. Following the incubation period, the sample
is basified and applied to a supported liquid extraction plate. The two
analytes are extracted with 5% (v/v) isopropanol in methylene chloride. The
organic extract is concentrated and the residue is injected onto a C18 UHPLC
(ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography) column. The eluent from these
injections is monitored by atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
(APCI)-MS/MS. One quantitation transition, one confirmation transition, and
one corresponding internal standard transition are monitored for each of the
two analytes.

Sample concentration is derived from the ratios of native-to-labeled compounds
in the sample by comparing to a standard curve. Adequate method performance
has been confirmed with criteria established internally.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Urinary nicotine metabolites and analogs (nicotine, nicotine-N-oxide,
cotinine-N-oxide, nornicotine, and 1-(3-Pyridyl)-1-butanol-4-carboxylic acid)
and urinary minor tobacco alkaloids (anatabine and anabasine) were not
measured if urinary cotinine (URXCOTT) results were less than 20 ng/mL.

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on
the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary cotinine, trans-3'-hydroxycotinine, and other nicotine metabolites and
analogs were assessed in a one-third subsample of persons 6 years and older.
Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific
sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be
used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.XPT) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.  

The laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Total Nicotine Equivalents (TNE) Calculations**

Total Nicotine Equivalents (TNE) were calculated for each analysis for which
total results were available for all analytes by dividing the concentration in
ng/mL by the MW for each analyte.  NIST's molecular weight, which include 4
digits after the decimal point were used in TNE calculations. If any of the
individual analyte values used in the respective formulas are missing, the TNE
variable was set to missing.

**TNE-2 =**(Total Cotinine /176.2151) + (Total
Trans-3'-Hydroxycotinine/192.2145) nmol/mL

**TNE-3 =** (Total Nicotine/162.2316) + (Total Cotinine /176.2151) + (Total
Trans-3'-Hydroxycotinine/192.2145) nmol/mL

**TNE-6 =**(Total Nicotine/162.2316) + (Total Cotinine /176.2151) + (Total
Trans-3'-Hydroxycotinine/192.2145) + (Total (S)-Cotinine N-oxide/ 192.2145) +
((1'S,2'S)-Nicotine 1'-oxide/ 178.231) + ((R,S)-Nornicotine/ 148.2050) nmol/mL

**TNE-7 =**(Total Nicotine/162.2316) + (Total Cotinine /176.2151) + (Total
Trans-3'-Hydroxycotinine/192.2145) + (Total (S)-Cotinine N-oxide/ 192.2145) +
((1'S,2'S)-Nicotine 1'-oxide/ 178.231) + ((R,S)-Nornicotine/ 148.2050) +
(1-(3-Pyridyl)-1-butanol-4-carboxylic acid)/ 181.1885) nmol/mL

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDCOTLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex. URDCOTLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex.,
URXCOTT) provides the analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ng/mL) for Cotinine, Hydroxycotinine, &
Nicotine Metabolites and Analogs in urine is:

**VARIABLE** |  **ANALYTE NAME** |  **LLOD**
