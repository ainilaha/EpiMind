### Folate Forms - Individual - Serum (FOLFMS_E)

####  Data File: FOLFMS_E.xpt

##### First Published: May 2014

##### Last Revised: February 2019

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are to: 1) provide data for monitoring
secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2)
evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors, such as physical
activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on
nutritional status; and 3) evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and
public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food
fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status
of the U.S. population.

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroup, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used in research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 1 year and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Different folate forms (5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate [5-methylTHF], folic acid,
5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate [5-formylTHF], tetrahydrofolate [THF], and
5,10-methenyl-tetrahydrofolate [5,10-methenylTHF]) were measured by the CDC
Nutritional Biomarkers Laboratory using an isotope-dilution liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method (Pfeiffer, et al.
2004; Fazili and Pfeiffer, 2004). Serum was combined with buffer and an
internal standard mixture and sample clean-up was performed using automated
solid phase extraction on phenyl cartridges in the 96-well plate format.
Folates were eluted from the cartridge and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Quantitation
was by peak area ratio (analyte to internal standard) and was based on a six-
point calibration curve in an aqueous medium.

The method performance was described in the proceedings of the 2010 Roundtable
on âNHANES monitoring of biomarkers of folate and vitamin B-12 statusâ
(Yetley, et al. 2011). Results were reported for two folate forms:
5-methylTHF, the major folate vitamer circulating in serum, and folic acid,
which may appear in serum if intake of folic acid from fortified food or
supplements exceeds 200 micrograms per meal. Results were not reported for the
other three minor folate forms (5-formylTHF, THF, and 5,10-methenylTHF). What
was measured as 5-formylTHF was in fact the sum of 5-formylTHF and an
oxidation product of 5-methylTHF known as MeFox (pyrazino-s-triazine
derivative of 4Î±-hydroxy-5-methylTHF) (Fazili and Pfeiffer, 2013). More
recently, the LC-MS/MS method has been improved to separate and accurately
measure 5-formylTHF and MeFox in addition to the other folate forms (Fazili
and Pfeiffer, 2013). This improved method has been used to generate data for
all folate forms in a full sample of NHANES 2011â2012. Data for 5-methylTHF
and folic acid in the current NHANES 2007â2008 one-third sample are
comparable to the data in NHANES 2011â2012.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed description on the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedure Manual
(LPM)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_07_08/manual_lab.pdf). Vials
are stored under appropriate frozen (-20oC) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_07_08/manual_lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during âdry runâ sessions. In addition,
contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciencesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2007-2008 Laboratory Data
](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes2007-2008/labdoc_e.htm)Overview for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES[ Analytic Guidelines
](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm)and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/index.htm) for details on the
use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Serum folate forms were measured in a one-third subsample of persons 1 year
and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**NHANES Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2007-2008 Demographics
File
](http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2007)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire File
](http://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2007-2008/FASTQX_E.htm)includes auxiliary
information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and the
conditions precluding venipuncture.  
  
This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).  
  
**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in âLCâ (ex., LBDSF1LC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above
the limit of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection. The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXSF1SI) provides the
analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the
lower limit of detection (ex., LBDSF1LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed
in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection
divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The lower limit of detection
(LLOD in nmol/L) for LBXSF1SI and LBXSF2SI are:

**Variable Name** |  **SAS Label** |  **  LLOD (nmol/L)**  
---|---|---  
LBXSF1SI |  5-Methyl-tetrahydrofolate |   0.5  
LBXSF2SI |  Folic acid |   0.3  
  
  

**No Correction Needed for Serum Folic Acid Results for NHANES 2007â2008**

For NHANES samples collected in the 2007-2008 cycle, the CDC Nutritional
Biomarkers Laboratory measured serum 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate and folic acid
by isotope-dilution high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and the NHANES data were first published in May
2014. In 2015, the CDC laboratory discovered a calibration bias in the folic
acid determination that resulted in overestimation of folic acid
concentrations by about 25% as a result of solubility issues with the
calibrator (see Analytic Notes for âFolate Forms â Serumâ in NHANES
2011â2012). The laboratory corrected the assay and conducted a crossover
study to assess whether folic acid data from NHANES 2007â2008, which were
analyzed a few years prior to the NHANES 2011â2012, needed to be adjusted.

The CDC laboratory randomly selected approximately 10% of the NHANES
2007â2008 serum samples stratified by 4 time periods based on date of
analysis (n = 300) and reanalyzed 25% of samples from each time period by
random selection based on available sample volume (n = 75; concentration range
0.34â14.1 nmol/L). The Pearson correlation for new vs. original folic acid
results was r = 0.989 and the weighted Deming regression equation did not show
a significant slope or intercept (95% confidence interval for slope included 1
and for intercept included 0) (nmol/L):

New folic acid = 0.9570 * Original folic acid â 0.01359; 95% CI of slope
(0.85 to 1.06) and intercept (-0.1016 to 0.07445).

Therefore, the NHANES 2007â2008 serum folic acid results did not have to be
adjusted.

**Comparability of Serum 5-methylTHF and Folic Acid Concentrations in NHANES
2007-2008 versus NHANES 1999-2002**

Serum 5-methylTHF and folic acid concentrations were measured by Tufts
University using HPLC with electrochemical detection in American seniors
(â¥60 y) in NHANES 1999â2002 as part of a surplus specimen project to
assess the relationship to anemia, macrocytosis and cognitive test performance
(Bailey, et al. 2010; Morris, et al. 2010). To assess method differences
between Tufts and CDC, a method comparison study was performed in 2013 on 311
surplus serum specimens from American seniors (â¥60 y) in NHANES 2001â2002.
Results for serum 5-methylTHF compared well between the two methods: mean (95%
CI, nmol/L): 47.7 (44.5â50.9) [CDC] and 48.6 (45.8â51.4) [Tufts]; median
(95% CI, nmol/L): 42.9 (38.2â45.4) [CDC] and 45.0 (41.3â48.0) [Tufts];
Pearson r: 0.89; no bias based on Deming regression (using log-transformed
data) and Bland Altman relative difference analysis. The CDC folic acid
results in this method comparison study had to be corrected for the above
mentioned calibration bias which occurred after 2011 and resulted in
overestimation of folic acid concentrations by about 25% due to solubility
issues with the calibrator (see analytic note for â[Folate Forms â
Serum](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/FOLFMS_G.htm)[ â in NHANES
2011â2012](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/FOLFMS_G.htm)). The
equation used to correct the CDC folic acid concentrations in this method
study was: New folic acid = 0.7586 * Original folic acid â 0.00016. The CDC
method detected folic acid in all samples (LOD = 0.09 nmol/L), while the
detection rate of the Tufts method (LOD = 0.18 nmol/L) was ~35% in the full
sample set (n = 1330; See the 2001-2002 Surplus Sera Folate data). Overall,
the correlation was low in the surplus sample set (Pearson r: 0.64, n = 311).
In the subset of samples that had detectable folic acid results by the Tufts
method (n = 163) and that did not include extreme outliers (n = 156;
difference between the two results was <20 nmol/L), the CDC folic acid results
were on average comparable to the Tufts results: mean (95% CI, nmol/L): 3.71
(2.40â5.02) [CDC] and 3.11 (2.19â4.02) [Tufts]; median (95% CI, nmol/L):
1.10 (0.99â1.37) [CDC] and 1.20 (0.88â1.62) [Tufts]; Pearson r: 0.92;
Deming slope using log-transformed data (95%CI): 0.89 (0.76 to 1.02); Deming
intercept using log-transformed data (95% CI): 0.06 (0.00 to 0.12); Bland
Altman relative difference (95% CI): 10.3% (-1.9% to 22.5%). Samples with
sufficient sample volume (n = 17) were repeated by the CDC method; the repeat
results confirmed the original results and were on average (SD) 5% (7%) higher
for UMFA and 2% (5%) higher for 5-methylTHF. The findings from this method
comparison study suggest that the NHANES 1999â2002 Tufts surplus results can
be compared for 5-methylTHF to the NHANES 2007â2008 CDC results but the
comparability for folic acid is limited due to the different detection rates
for these two methods.
