### Perchlorate - Urine (L04PER_C)

####  Data File: L04PER_C.xpt

#####  First Published: August 2008

#####  Last Revised: March 2011

## Component Description

Perchlorate has been used as an oxidant in solid fuel propellants for rockets
and missiles since the 1950s. Lesser amounts of perchlorate are used in
matches and fireworks. Perchlorate can also form naturally in the environment
and can accumulate in nitrate-rich mineral deposits mined for use in
fertilizers. Drinking water, milk, and certain plants with high water content
(e.g., lettuce) can be the main sources of perchlorate intake for humans.
Perchlorate has been used medically to treat hyperthyroidism. Its inhibitory
effect on thyroid hormone production has led to concerns that exposure even to
low levels of perchlorate in the environment might affect vulnerable groups,
such as pregnant women with inadequate iodine intake and infants for whom
thyroid hormone levels must be maintained adequately for normal brain
development. Perchlorate taken into the body is rapidly eliminated in the
urine, within a matter of hours. Measurement of urinary perchlorate is useful
to assess recent human exposure.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older on a 1/3 sample were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure for the measurement of perchlorate in
human urine using ion chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass
spectrometry. Chromatographic separation is achieved using an IonPac AS16
column with 100 mM sodium hydroxide as the eluant. The eluant from the column
is ionized using an electrospray interface to generate and transmit negative
ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative response factors
(ratio of native analyte to stable isotope labeled internal standard) with
known standard concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations. The
method is applicable to the determination of perchlorate in 0.5 mL of urine
over the range 0.05 to 100 ng/mL.

## Data Processing and Editing

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
second examinations on previously examined participants and blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

**Revised Analytical Note For NHANES 2001-2004 Urinary Perchlorate, Nitrate,
And Thiocyanate Analysis (Revised February 2011)**

**Data Advisory**

The purpose of this revised note is to inform users that urinary perchlorate,
nitrate, and thiocyanate data from NHANES 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 have been
adjusted for laboratory methodological changes, and have replaced previous
urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate files. In the ongoing pursuit of
new technology and method quality improvement, we discovered a slight bias
(-4.7%) in the sample volume accuracy of the aliquoting technique used to
measure urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate in NHANES 2001-2004.
This bias can be diminished by manually pre-rinsing each pipette tip with
sample or by using an automated aliquoting system such as a Hamilton MicroLab
Star (Hamilton Robotics, Inc. Reno, NV). Due to this slight bias in volume
accuracy we adjusted analytical measurements for all NHANES 2001-2004 samples
by a factor of 1.049. No further adjustment is needed.

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary perchlorate were measured in a one third subsample of
persons 6 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these
data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this
data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detections limits for urinary perchlorate measures were constant during
this two-year period.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
