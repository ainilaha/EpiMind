### Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA), Second Exam (l11p_2_b)

####  Data File: l11p_2_b.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2010

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Free Prostate-specific Antigen (P1), Total Prostate-specific Antigen (P2):
Total and free Prostate-specific antigens (PSA) were measured among men age
40-69 years. PSA immunoassay was performed on blood specimens using the
Hybritech tests (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).

See the general documentation on Second Day laboratory exams.Â Also, see the
documentation for the primary exam data for Lab 11 PSA.

## Eligible Sample

Male participants aged 40-69 years were tested for PSA.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Free Prostate-specific Antigen (LB2P1):**  
The Access Hybritech free PSA assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic "sandwich"
assay. A sample was added to a reaction vessel with mouse monoclonal anti-free
PSA alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coated with a
second mouse monoclonal anti-free PSA antibody. The free PSA in the sample
bound to the immobilized monoclonal anti-free PSA on the solid phase while, at
the same time, the monoclonal anti-PSA conjugate reacted with a different
antigenic site on the sample free PSA. Separation in a magnetic field and
washing removes material not bound to the solid phase. A chemiluminescent
substrate, Lumi-Phostm 530 was added to the reaction vessel and light
generated by the reaction was measured with a luminometer. The light
production was proportional to the concentration of free PSA in the sample.
The amount of analyte in the sample was determined by means of a stored,
multi-point calibration curve.

**Total Prostate- specific Antigen (LB2P2):** Â  
Total PSA values were obtained using the Hybritech PSA method on the Beckman
Access. A second sample was added to a reaction vessel with mouse monoclonal
anti-PSA alkaline phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with
a second mouse monoclonal anti-PSA antibody. The PSA in the sample bound to
the immobilized monoclonal anti-PSA on the solid phase while, at the same
time, the monoclonal anti-PSA conjugate reacted with a different antigenic
site on the sample PSA. The light production was proportional to the
concentration of PSA in the sample..

**Prostate-specific Antigen ratio (LB2P3):** Â  
This ratio was calculated by dividing the free PSA (P1) by the total PSA (P2):  
LB2P3 = round ((LB2P2/LB2P1)*100))



## Data Processing and Editing

Specimens were processed, stored and shipped to University of Washington,
Seattle, Washington. Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data processing and editing
protocols. The analytical methods are described in the Description of
Laboratory Methodology section.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

All data are publicly available.

The second day exam data was a convenience sample and thus did not have sample
weights. The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key
survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Questionnaire Data
Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. The Phlebotomy Examination
File includes auxiliary information such the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy files may be linked
to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier
SEQN.

Data on health conditions that would make a sample person ineligible for PSA
testing are missing for some people (n=60) with non-missing PSA lab data. This
happened mainly because some sample persons did not attend the physicianâs
examination component of the MEC examination where such data were collected.
It is advisable to exclude these observations for PSA analyses.
