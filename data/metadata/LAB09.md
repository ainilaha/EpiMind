### Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 & Type-2 (lab09)

####  Data File: lab09.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2002

#####  Last Revised: May 2010

## Component Description

**Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1)**

Sera from NHANES examinees aged 14â49 were tested for antibody to herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 is a common chronic infection that is the
cause of most oral herpes or cold sores.

**Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2)**

Sera from NHANES examinees aged 14â49 were tested for antibody to herpes
simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted infection and
can be used as a marker for sexual transmission of other infectious agents.
HSV-2 infections are rarely life threatening, but morbidity due to painful
genital ulcerations is significant.

HSV-2 infection is one of the best markers of sexual risk factors leading to
sexually transmitted infections, because: (a) HSV-2 infections are common and,
thus, HSV-2 rates are a measure of sexual risk in the broader population
beyond high risk groups; (b) HSV-2 infection is almost always a result of
sexual transmission and, thus, a specific measure of sexually transmitted
infection; (c) HSV-2 infections are not curable and, thus, HSV-2 risk is not
influenced by health care-seeking factors; and (d) sensitive, specific, and
relatively inexpensive tests for HSV-2 antibody are available. HSV-2 is a very
important marker for monitoring the impact of large national efforts,
motivated by the HIV epidemic, to reduce risky sexual behaviors.

The NHANES laboratory data can be linked to NHANES sexual behavior questions
to assist in the understanding of national trends in HIV and sexually
transmitted diseases. The availability of sexually transmitted infection and
risk factors data in a national sample over time is a unique and invaluable
resource for evaluation of national HIV/STD risk-reduction efforts and for
risk-based modeling of the burden and trends of sexually transmitted
infections.

## Eligible Sample

Participants 14â49 years of age who did not meet any of the exclusion
criteria were tested for HSV-1 and HSV-2. The public release data file
includes HSV-1 data for persons 14â49 years, and HSV-2 data for persons
18â49 years of age. Please see **Analytic Notes** about availability of
HSV-2 data for persons 14â17 years of age.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Blood specimens collected through venipuncture were processed, stored, and
shipped to Emory University for testing. Detailed specimen collection and
processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

Although extensive antigenic cross-reactivity exists between the two viral
types of herpes, a viral glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) (designated gG-2) and a glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) (designated gG-1) have been identified. Monoclonal antibodies
and affinity chromatography have been used to purify these glycoproteins and
thus provide antigens for type-specific herpes serologic assays. Solid-phase
enzymatic immunodot assays are used to detect antibodies reactive to these
antigens. The purified glycoprotein, gG-1 or gG-2, is adsorbed to the center
of a nitrocellulose disk. The rest of the disk surface is coated with bovine
serum albumin to prevent further nonspecific protein adsorption. Incubation of
test serum with the disk allows specific antibodies, if present, to bind to
the immobilized antigen. After extensive washing to remove non-reactive
antibodies, the bound antibodies are detected by sequential treatment with
peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG and the enzyme substrate (H2O2 with
chromogen 4-chloro-1-naphthol). A positive reaction is demonstrated by the
appearance of a blue dot at the center of the disk. Serum reactive to an
immunodot charged with gG-1 indicates the person being tested has HSV-1
infection. Serum reactive to an immunodot charged with gG-2 indicates the
person being tested has HSV-2 infection.

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.

A detailed description of the laboratory method used can be found on the
NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the _General Documentation of Laboratory Data_ file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
**Description of the Laboratory Methodology** section.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). _Read the General Documentation of Laboratory Data_ file for detailed
QA/QC protocols.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

**Laboratory Results**

The items LBXHE1 and LBXHE2 represent type-specific enzymatic immunodot assay
results.

The type-specific immunodot assays used to detect antibodies reactive to HSV-1
& HSV-2 antigens in NHANES 2007-2008 are the same assays as those used in
NHANES 1999-2006 and NHANES III. Therefore, HSV-1 and HSV-2 results from these
surveys are identical and comparable for trend analyses.

**Data Access**

The public release data file includes HSV-1 data for participants aged 14-49
and HSV-2 data for participants aged 18-49\. HSV-2 data for youth aged 14-17
years are available through the [NCHS Research Data Center
(RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the Analytic
Guidelines for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues. The Analytic Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
