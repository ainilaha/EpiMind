### Physical Functioning (PFQ)

####  Data File: PFQ.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2002

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The physical function section(variable name prefix PFQ) provides self-reported
data on functional limitations caused by long-term physical, mental, and
emotional problems or illnesses. It can be used to assess an individual's
level of disability.

**Topics and target population groups**

  * All participants 1 to 4 years of age were asked about play activities. 
  * All participants 1 to 19 years of age were asked about mobility (crawl, walk, run). 
  * All participants 1 to 15 years of age were asked about receiving Special Education or Early Intervention Services. 
  * All participants 20 years of age and older were asked about their ability to work at a job or business. Participants were also asked a series of questions designed to measure their functional status. These questions were phrased to assess the individual's level of difficulty in performing the task without using any special equipment. Functional limitations were assessed based on scales of activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), mobility & upper/lower body strength, and social participation. Participants were asked to select from a list of health problems in order to determine the reason for the disability or limitations. 

## Eligible Sample

All participants 1 year and older.
