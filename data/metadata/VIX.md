## 1999-2000 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Vision (VIX)

####  Data File: VIX.xpt

##### First Published: June 2002

##### Last Revised: February 2005

## Component Description

The NHANES data will be used to:

  1. measure the prevalence of visual acuity impairment in the U.S. population (visual acuity worse than 20/40); 
  2. measure the distribution of refractive error in the U.S. population; and 
  3. evaluate functional impairment related to vision. 

## Eligible Sample

All sample persons aged 12+ years were eligible to participate in the
refraction exam. The protocol included: measuring the eyeglass prescription in
people who wore glasses for distance; testing the presenting distance visual
acuity of sample persons with their usual correction (glasses/contacts or
none); obtaining an objective refraction (incorporating also an evaluation of
the corneal curvature of the eye); and, for sample persons whose presenting
distance acuity was 20/30 or worse, distance visual acuity after objective
refraction. In addition, a visual acuity at near was assessed only on persons
50 years and over.

Participants who were determined to be completely blind or unable to see in
both eyes as well as sample persons with a severe infection (i.e., purulent
discharge with redness and inflammation) in one or both eyes were excluded
from this exam.

## Protocol and Procedure

**Examination Protocol**

The vision exam included measurements of:

  1. eyeglass prescription for glasses used to view distant objects, 
  2. presenting visual acuity with current correction, 
  3. objective refraction, 
  4. visual acuity incorporating objective refraction, and 
  5. near vision acuity. 

Screening questions were asked of all participants age 12 years and older. If
the sample person wore eyeglasses to see distant objects, current eyeglass
prescription was determined using a lensmeter. Presenting visual acuity was
tested with current correction, if any. Objective refraction and corneal
curvature data were obtained by averaging three autoretinoscopy measurements.
Visual acuity with objective refraction is assessed only on sample persons
whose initial, presenting visual acuity was 20/30 or worse. For sample persons
aged 50 years and older, near vision was tested with a near-vision card and
usual reading distance was recorded prior to measuring their presenting
distance visual acuity.

**Survey Staff**

The MEC health technicians conducted the vision examination. These technicians
received 8 weeks of training initially and subsequently underwent updates and
remedial training as needed. Technicians referred to the Vision Procedures
Manual for specific instructions for the administration of this component.

**Data Collection Forms**

Two screening questions were completed by the health technician and involved
observation of the subject to determine if the medical exclusion criteria
apply. The sample person was then asked additional screening questions (e.g.
do they wear any distance correction) to determine which measurements in the
examination protocol were relevant.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

A variety of quality control procedures were used to ensure the accurate and
reliable collection of vision data. Calibrations of the lensmeter and the
autorefractor were performed prior to conducting examinations at each survey
location, and weekly thereafter. At regular intervals, NCHS and contractor
staffs observed vision examinations conducted in the MEC to evaluate whether
appropriate procedures and techniques were being followed. Retraining sessions
were conducted with all MEC health technicians to review data collection
procedures.

## Data Processing and Editing

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were used to collect the
vision data. Eyeglass prescription data were captured electronically by the
lensmeter, and the objective refraction and visual acuity data were captured
by the autorefractor. Both sets of data were then transferred to the survey
database system. Visual acuity data values were also captured by the
technician and entered directly into the database.

## Analytic Notes

Users are encouraged to carefully note the English instructions describing the
various variables in the codebook documentation.

**Special Notes about this Dataset**

This dataset only contains data for the vision examination conducted in the
MEC. There is another dataset containing household interview responses to the
vision section (VIQ) of the Sample Person Questionnaire. Data from the two
datasets can be combined and analyzed using the guidelines provided by NCHS.
Note that not all of the same persons appear in the household interview and
MEC examination datasets.
