## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the
United States. Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and
control of hepatitis C virus  
(HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic infection with these
viruses, information about the prevalence of these diseases is needed to
monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally representative sample of
the U.S. population, NHANES will provide the most reliable estimates of age-
specific prevalence needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies to
prevent these infections. In  
addition, NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other
hepatitis viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis
viruses will be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across
most age and racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the
epidemiologic determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 2 years and older are eligible to be tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The AUSAB EIA for anti-HBs uses the "sandwich principle" a solid phase enzyme-
linked immunoassay technique (1, 2) to detect anti-HBs levels in serum or
plasma. Polystyrene beads coated with human Hepatitis B Surface Antigen
(HBsAg) are incubated with either the patient specimen or the appropriate
controls.

During incubation, antibody, if present, is immunologically coupled to the
solid phase antigen. After removal of the unbound material and washing of the
bead, human HBsAg tagged with biotin (B-HBsAg) and rabbit anti-biotin,
conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (anti-H- HRPO), are incubated with the
antibody-antigen complex on the beads. The biotinylated surface antigen binds
to this complex crating an antigen-antibody-antigen "sandwich". The anti-
biotin horseradish peroxidase binds to the biotin component of the "sandwich",
forming a sold phase network. Unbound conjugates are removed and the beads are
washed. Next, o-Phenylenediamine (OPD) solution containing hydrogen peroxide
is added to the bead, and after incubation, a yellow color develops in
proportion to the amount of anti-HBs which is bound to the bead. Within
limits, the greater the amount of antibody in the sample, the higher the
absorbance. The enzyme reaction is stopped by the addition of acid. The
absorbance of controls and specimens is determined using a spectrophotometer
with wavelength set at 492 nm. Testing for anti-HBs can be useful for: a)
evaluating the recovery and prognosis of patents infected with HBV, b)
screening for potential vaccine recipients, and c) epidemiologic factors
associated with transmission of HBV. The detection of anti-HBs is indicative
of a prior immunologic exposure to the antigen or vaccine.

The anti-HBs standards contained in the AUSAB quantitation panel kit are
assayed with the AUSAB EIA for the quantitative determination of anti-HBs in
human serum or plasma. The concentration of anti-HBs expressed in milli-
international units per mL (mIU/mL) is determined by comparison with a
standard curve generated from measurement of the standards run in duplicate
with the AUSAB EIA kit. A curve is obtained by plotting the anti-HBs
concentration of the standard vs. the absorbance. The anti-HBs concentration
of specimens run concurrently with the standards can then be read from the
curve. Specimens with values above the highest standard can be diluted with
the specimen dilution buffer and retested. For the purposes of this study,
samples with an absorbance above the highest standard curve will not be
diluted, but reported out as > 150 mIU/mL.

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for Infectious Diseases, National Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Detailed specimen collection and  
processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM. Read the LABDOC file
for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are
described in the Description of Laboratory Methodology section above. Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found on the NHANES
website.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols. A detailed description of the quality assurance
and quality control procedures can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. They also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups. The
phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may
be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.
