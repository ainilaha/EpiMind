### Cadmium, Lead, Total Mercury, Selenium, & Manganese - Blood (PbCd_G)

####  Data File: PbCd_G.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Lead**

Lead is a known environmental toxin that has been shown to deleteriously
affect the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and reproductive systems.
In young children, lead exposure is a particular hazard because children more
readily absorb lead than do adults, and children's developing nervous systems
also make them more susceptible to the effects of lead. The primary sources of
exposure for children are lead-laden paint chips and dust as a result of
deteriorating lead-based paint. The risk for lead exposure is
disproportionately higher for children who are poor, non-Hispanic black,
living in large metropolitan areas, or living in older housing. Among adults,
the most common high exposure sources are occupational. Blood lead levels
measured in previous NHANES programs have been the cornerstone of lead
exposure surveillance in the U.S. The data have been used to document the
burden and dramatic decline of elevated blood lead levels, to promote the
reduction of lead use, and to help to redefine national lead poisoning
prevention guidelines, standards, and abatement activities.

**Cadmium**

A cadmium assay is performed to identify cases of cadmium toxicity.
Occupational exposure is the most common cause of elevated cadmium levels.

**Manganese**

The greatest demand for manganese is for the production of iron and steel. In
addition, it is a key component of low-cost stainless steel and certain
aluminum alloys. At low concentrations, it is used to decolorize glass, while
at higher concentrations, it is used to make violet-colored glass. Manganese
dioxide, besides being a useful pigment, is a catalyst and a component of
certain dry cell batteries. Potassium permanganate is a potent oxidizer and
disinfectant. Manganese (in the form of manganese ions) is an essential trace
nutrient in all known forms of life. On the other hand, excess manganese is
toxic.

**Total Mercury**

Uncertainties exist regarding levels of exposure to methyl mercury from fish
consumption and potential health effects resulting from this exposure. Past
estimates of exposure to methyl mercury have been obtained from results of
food consumption surveys and measures of methyl mercury in fish. Measures of a
biomarker of exposure are needed for improved exposure assessments. Blood
mercury levels will be assessed in two subpopulations particularly vulnerable
to the health effects from mercury exposure: children 1-5 years old and women
of childbearing age.

Blood measures of total and inorganic mercury will be important for evaluation
of exposure from exposure to mercury in interior latex paints

**Selenium**

Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for
cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is a
component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin
reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and
some plants). It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes, which convert one
thyroid hormone to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species,
with some plants requiring relatively large amounts, and others apparently
requiring none.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 1 year and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Whole blood specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found in
the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

Whole blood lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) , total mercury (THg) manganese (Mn), and
selenium (Se) concentrations are determined using inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry. This multi-element analytical technique is based on
quadrupole ICP-MS technology. Coupling radio frequency power into a flowing
argon stream seeded with electrons creates the plasma. Predominate species in
the plasma are positive argon ions and electrons. Diluted whole blood samples
are converted into an aerosol using a nebulizer inserted within a spray
chamber. A portion of the aerosol is transported through the spray chamber and
then through the central channel of the plasma, where it experiences
temperatures of 6000-8000 oK. This thermal energy atomizes and ionizes the
sample. The ions, along with the argon, enter the mass spectrometer through an
interface that separates the ICP, operating at atmospheric pressure
(approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer, operating at
approximately 10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer permits detection of ions at
each mass-to-charge ratio in rapid sequence, allowing individual isotopes of
an element to be determined. Once inside of the mass spectrometer, the ions
pass through the ion optics, then the mass analyzing quadrupole before being
detected as they strike the surface of the detector. The ion optics focuses
the ion beam using an electrical field.  
  
Electrical signals resulting from the detection of the ions are processed into
digital information that is used to indicate the intensity of the ions and
subsequently the concentration of the element. In this method blood samples
are diluted with 18 M-ohm water and with diluent, containing 1% v/v
tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), 0.05% disodium ethylenediamine
tetraacetate (EDTA), 5% ethyl alcohol, 0.05% Triton X-100?, Au is added to
reduce intrinsic Hg memory effects, Rh for internal standardization of Cd, and
Bi for internal standardization of Hg and Pb [11-13]. The samples were
prepared with the following ratio Sample: Water: Diluent = 1:1:48
correspondingly.

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site. Testing for selenium and manganese was added in 2011.

## Data Processing and Editing

Five additional variables were created for this data file. The formula for
their creation is as follows:

  * The cadmium in µg/L was converted to nmol/L by multiplying by 8.897. 
  * The lead in µg/dL was converted to µmol/L by multiplying by 0.0483. 
  * The manganese in µg/L was converted to nmol/L by multiplying by 18.202. 
  * The selenium in µg/L was converted to µmol/L by multiplying by 0.0127. 
  * The mercury in µg/L was converted to nmol/L by multiplying by 4.99. 

**Detection Limits  
**The detection limit for all analytes was constant in the data set. The lower
detection limits for lead were 0.25 µg/dL and 0.16 µg/L for cadmium, selenium
was 30 ug/L, manganese was 1.06 ug/L, and 0.16 µg/L for total mercury.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Read the General
Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed QA/QC protocols. Detailed
QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/fastqx_g.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

In cases, where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for
that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of two.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
