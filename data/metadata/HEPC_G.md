## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the
United States. Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and
control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of
asymptomatic infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of
these diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a
nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide
the most reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will
be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 6 years or older are eligible to be tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Detailed instructions
on specimen collection and processing can be found on the NHANES website.  
  
Hepatitis C Antibody (anti-HCV)  
  
The VITROS Anti-HCV assay is performed using the VITROS Anti-HCV Reagent Pack
and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HCV Calibrator on the VITROS
ECi/ECiQ or VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.  
  
An immunometric technique is used. This involves a two-stage reaction. In the
first stage, HCV antibody present in the sample binds with HCV recombinant
antigens coated on the wells. Unbound sample is removed by washing. In the
second stage, horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody conjugate (mouse
monoclonal anti-human IgG) binds to any human IgG captured on the well in the
first stage. Unbound conjugate is removed by washing.  
  
A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a
peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP
in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative,
producing light. The electron transfer agent increases the level and duration
of the light produced. The light signals are read by the VITROS ECi/ECiQ or
VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is
indicative of the level of anti-HCV present in the sample.  
  
Positive specimens are repeated in duplicate according to the same procedure.
Repeatedly positive specimens are tested supplementally using the Chiron RIBA
Processor System (Chiron Corporation, Inc.).  
  
The Chiron RIBA HCV 3.0 Strip (confirmation test)  
The Chiron RIBA 3.0 Strip Immunoblot Assay (SIA; Chiron Corporation, Inc.) is
an in vitro qualitative enzyme immunoassay for the detection of anti-HCV in
human serum or plasma.  
  
Detection of anti-HCV by SIA methodology is based upon traditional Western and
dot blotting techniques, in which specific immunogens (i.e. antigenic
polyproteins) encoded by the HCV genome are immobilized onto a membrane
support. Visualization of anti-HCV reactivity in specimens to the individual
HCV-encoded proteins is accomplished with anti-human IgG enzyme-conjugates in
conjunction with a colorimetric enzyme substrate. Samples with a positive RIBA
result are reported as confirmed positive for antibody to HCV. Samples with a
negative RIBA result are reported as negative for antibody to HCV and
indeterminate RIBA results are reported as indeterminate.  
  
Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA)  
The AMPLIPREP COBAS TaqMan HCV Test is an in vitro nucleic acid amplification
test for the quantitation of Hepatitis C Virus RNA in human serum or plasma
performed on the COBAS AMPLIPREP Instrument and the COBAS TaqMan 48 Analyzer.  
  
Hepatitis C genotype  
The VERSANT® HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay (LiPA) is a line probe assay designed to
identify Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 to 6 in human serum or EDTA
plasma samples. Subtype information is available in the majority of cases.  
  
There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods, or lab site for anti-HCV, RIBA or genotype testing. The AMPLIPREP
COBAS TaqMan HCV Test replaced the COBAS AMPLICOR HCV Test for HCV RNA
testing.

## Data Processing and Editing

The analytical methods are described in the _Description of Laboratory
Methodology_ section above.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/fastqx_g.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).



The age range and constraints for hepatitis C testing are as follows:

The screening hepatitis C antibody test is performed on all examinees 6 years
old or older. Samples testing positive for anti-HCV by the screening test were
tested in the confirmatory RIBA assay for antibody to hepatitis C virus.
Samples with a positive RIBA result are reported as confirmed positive for
antibody to HCV. Samples with a negative RIBA result are reported as negative
for antibody to HCV. Samples with an indeterminate RIBA result are reported
out as such and subsequently tested for HCV RNA to confirm the infection
status of the patient. Samples that tested negative for anti-HCV by the
screening test were not tested by RIBA. These samples were reported as
negative for antibody to HCV. Samples that tested positive or indeterminate
for HCV RNA were subsequently tested for HCV genotype.  
  
Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
