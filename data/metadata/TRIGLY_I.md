## 2015-2016 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Cholesterol - Low - Density Lipoprotein (LDL) & Triglycerides (TRIGLY_I)

####  Data File: TRIGLY_I.xpt

##### First Published: January 2019

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The goals of this component are: 1) to monitor the prevalence and trends in
major cardiovascular conditions, and overall risk factors in the U.S.; and 2)
to evaluate prevention and treatment programs targeting cardiovascular disease
in the U.S.

Blood lipid levels are the main elements of the cardiovascular disease
laboratory in NHANES. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in
the United States. The data will be used to monitor the status of
hyperlipidemia, and the success of the National Cholesterol Education Program.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and older who were examined in the morning session
were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is based on the work by Wahlefeld (Roche, 2014) using a
lipoprotein lipase from microorganisms for the rapid and complete hydrolysis
of triglycerides to glycerol followed by oxidation to dihydroxyacetone
phosphate and hydrogen peroxide. The hydrogen peroxide produced then reacts
with 4-aminophenazone and 4-chlorophenol under the catalytic action of
peroxidase to form a red dyestuff (Trinder endpoint reaction). The color
intensity of the red dyestuff formed is directly proportional to the
triglyceride concentration and can be measured photometrically.

Triglycerides are fatty acid esters of glycerol that have three hydroxyl
groups. Because they are insoluble in water, the triglycerides are transported
with other more polar lipids. Elevated triglyceride measurements are
associated with diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, alcoholism, glycogen storage
disease, hypothyroidism, nephrosis, pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives and
gout. Triglyceride levels are decreased in hyperthyroidism, use of certain
lipid-lowering drugs and malabsorption syndrome.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to University of Minnesota for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Three derived variables were created in this data file. The variables were
created using the following formula:

**LBDTRSI**

The triglycerides value in mg/dL (LBXTR) was converted to mmol/L (LBDTRSI) by
multiplying by 0.01129.

**LBDLDL**

Serum Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels were derived on study
participants who were examined in the morning session only. The distribution
of serum LDL-cholesterol should be estimated only on participants aged 12 and
above who fasted at least 8.5 hours or more, but less than 24 hours in the
morning session. LDL-cholesterol is calculated from measured values of total
cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol according to the Friedewald
calculation:

**[LDL-cholesterol] = [total cholesterol] - [HDL-cholesterol] -
[triglycerides/5]**

where all values are expressed in mg/dL. The calculation is valid for
triglycerides less than or equal to 400 mg/dL.

**LBDLDLSI**

The LDL-cholesterol in mg/dL (LBDLDL) was converted to mmol/L (LBDLDLSI) by
multiplying by 0.02586.

  

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**  
  
Triglycerides were measured in a fasting subsample of participants 12 years
and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2015-2016/fastqx_i.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

The laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**LBXTR and LBXLDL**

Serum levels were measured for participants that were examined in the morning
session only. The distribution of serum triglycerides should be estimated only
on participants aged 12 and above who fasted at least 8.5 hours or more, but
less than 24 hours.

The TRIGLY_I data file contains laboratory test results for triglycerides
(LBXTR) using the reference analytic method. However, the NHANES Standard
Biochemistry Profile (BIOPRO_I) also includes measurements of triglycerides
(LBXSTR). The appropriate variable to use for the most accurate data analysis
is **LBXTR** from the TRIGLY_I data file.  
  
**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for this analyte in the data set. The
variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXTR) provides the analytic result for that
analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in mg/dL) for triglycerides:

**Variable Name** |  **SAS Label** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXTR |  Serum Triglycerides |  9  
  


Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
