## 2005-2006 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Oral Health (OHX_D)

####  Data File: OHX_D.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2008

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

NHANES is critical for monitoring oral health status, risk indicators for
disease, and access to preventive and treatment services. This component will
address public health significance in areas of surveillance, prevention,
treatment, dental care utilization, health policy, evaluation of Federal
health programs, standardization of new methods, and oral health disparities.
The purpose of this component is to assess the prevalence of oral conditions
and diseases, such as edentulism, denture use, dental sealants, and dental
caries. A concurrent set of questions administered during the household
interview assesses issues related to oral health quality of life.

Surveillance data will be collected on dental caries and sequelae for NHANES
2005-2006 using a person-based screening method.

This method, known as Basic Screening Examination (BSE), differs from previous
NHANES oral health protocols because it does not assess each tooth surface and
the assessments are not made by a dentist. NHANES will use a simplified
screening process to collect information on untreated caries, dental
restorations, and dental sealants. The protocol will be applied to all
examined persons 5 years or older and be conducted by a health technologist
(HT) rather than a dentist. In addition to performing the BSE the HT will
inquire about the use of dentures, perform a tooth count, and ascertain the
number of occlusal contacts using existing NHANES protocols.

The NHANES 2005-06 Oral Health Component is a collaborative effort between the
National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division
of Oral Health (NCCDPHP/DOH), and the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS).

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 5 years and older will be eligible for the Tooth count and
BSE. Additionally, persons aged 25 years and older will be eligible for a
brief denture questionnaire and functional contacts assessment.

## Protocol and Procedure

The oral health subcomponents for the examination component for participants
are as follows:

  1. A Denture Questionnaire used to assess denture wear for participants age 25 years and older. 
  2. A Tooth Count used to assess the number of teeth for participants age 5 years and older.
  3. A Basic Screening Exam used to asses the presence of at least one tooth with dental decay; at least one tooth with a dental restoration; and at least one tooth with at least one dental sealant for participants age 5 years and older. 
  4. A Functional Contacts Assessment for participants age 25 years and older 
  5. Recommendation of Care findings for participants age 5 years and older.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The quality of data in this survey is controlled by (1) an intense training
period for the health technologists who were assigned to conduct the oral
health examinations with calibration of OH examiners prior to the beginning of
the survey, (2) periodic monitoring and recalibration of OH examiners, and (3)
periodic retraining of OH examination teams. The reference examiner will visit
each team three times per year to observe field operations and to replicate 20
to 25 OH examinations during each visit. The purpose of these "expert
replications" is to determine if the field examiners are maintaining the
examination standards achieved during training and to measure the degree of
deviation, if any, from those standards. If the inter-rater correlation is not
within acceptable limits, retraining is conducted on site and future
monitoring of the field examiner intensified. An annual retraining session for
each dental examiner also is conducted by the reference examiner to reinforce
existing protocols and to accommodate protocol updates as needed. All OH
training, calibration, and field replicate exams were conducted by the NHANES
survey expert dentist.

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES
1999. In the mobile examination centers (MECs), data for the oral health
component are recorded directly onto a computerized data collection form. The
system is integrated centrally and it allows for ongoing monitoring of much of
the data. As part of an on-going quality control practice, all data are
reviewed systematically for logical inconsistencies and examiner error.
Internal quality control data review indicates that data quality is
acceptable.

## Data Processing and Editing

A limited number of hard edits were employed in the 2005-06 OH Examination.
For example, if an examiner identified all teeth as missing during Tooth
Count, then information for the BSE and Functional Contacts were automatically
filled in with "9's" (can not assess).

## Analytic Notes

For this release, it is recommended that the data should not be combined with
oral health data data from previous data cycles for analysis.

The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 oral health data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2005-2006
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. Other household questionnaire and oral questionnaire
files may be linked to the oral health examination data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.

Additionally, the NHANES 2005-2006 Household Questionnaire Data Files contains
information for an oral health questionnaire inquiring about dental
utilization and oral health related quality of life.

"Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website."
