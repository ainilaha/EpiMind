### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) - Multiplexed 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52 &
58 Antibody â Serum: 9-plex CLIA (HPVSRM_D)

####  Data File: HPVSRM_D.xpt

##### First Published: January 2015

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted
infection in the United States. Cervical infection with certain types of HPV
is causally associated with cervical cancer in women. No national surveillance
system exists to measure the full burden of HPV infection, and no reliable
national population estimate of HPV exists. NHANES offers a unique opportunity
to assess the prevalence of HPV infection in the general population.

Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Developmental Healthy People
2010 objective: "Reducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the
overall number of cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer
in females ..." Two HPV vaccines are licensed, and knowledge of the national
prevalence of HPV infection is critical for planning vaccination strategies
and monitoring the impact of vaccination in the United States.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 18 to 59 years were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The competitive Luminex Assay is based on the ability of antibodies in the
serum to compete with labeled type-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibody
for binding to beads coated with L1-Viral-like particles (VLPs).  The assay is
proprietary to Merck and licensed to Pharmaceutical Product Development (PPD),
Inc.  The 9-plex format includes beads with L1-VLPs and monoclonal antibodies
specific for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31,33,45,52 and 58.  Any class of Ig is
detected, but detection is restricted to the specific neutralizing epitope
recognized by the monoclonal antibody.  Quantitative results are reported in
terms of arbitrary units (milliMerck units/ml).  Threshold for positive
results established by Merck are used to report qualitative results (positive
\- at or above threshold; negative - below threshold).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored and shipped to the Chronic Viral Diseases
Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, National Center
for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf). Serum
were stored under appropriate frozen conditions (-20°C) until they were
shipped to the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases
for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2005-2006 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2005)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Sample Weights**

MEC exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2005-2006 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2005-2006/DEMO_D.XPT) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data, health indicators,
and other related information collected during household interviews. Certain
sensitive data on participants under 18 years of age (e.g., HPV typing
results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files.
These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines.

**Detection Limits**

If data is qualitative, the use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
