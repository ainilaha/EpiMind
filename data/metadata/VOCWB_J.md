### Volatile Organic Compounds and Trihalomethanes/MTBE - Blood (VOCWB_J)

####  Data File: VOCWB_J.xpt

##### First Published: October 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Volatile Organic Compounds and Trihalomethanes/MTBE (Whole Blood)**

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large group of chemicals that have
been used as solvents, degreasers, and cleaning agents in industry and
consumer products. Many of the VOCs were found to contaminate ground water and
drinking water sources. Because of human health concerns, these VOCs have been
banned or restricted from most uses.

The halogenated solvents are VOCs consisting of a hydrocarbon chain or one
hydrocarbon substituted with one or more chlorine or bromine atoms. Most of
these chemicals are used as degreasers and solvents in various products, such
as paint. In the past, 1,1,1-trichloroethane was used as a dry cleaning agent,
insect fumigant, and solvent in consumer products. Methylene chloride,
tetrachloroethene, and trichloroethene are other VOCs that were widely used in
the past.

Benzene, ethylbenzene, and xylene collectively referred to as BTEXS, are
components of tobacco smoke. Along with 2,5-dimethylfuran, these VOCs are
usually detected in the blood of cigarette smokers at higher levels than in
non-smokers. Chlorobenzene (monochlorobenzene) and the three dichlorobenzenes
are halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons primarily used in industrial and
chemical synthetic processes. Chlorobenzene has been used to produce DDT,
phenol, and nitrobenzene. The dichlorobenzenes are also chemical intermediates
in the synthesis of dyes, pesticides, and other industrial products.
1,4-Dichlorobenzene (para-dichlorobenzene) is used also as a moth repellent
and as a deodorizer. Disinfection by-products (DBP), including
bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, bromoform, and chloroform are
formed when chlorine interacts with natural organic materials found in water.
Primary sources of DBPs are chlorinated drinking water and recreational water
bodies, such as swimming pools.

The prevalence of disinfection by-products in drinking water supplies has
raised concerns about possible adverse health effects from chronic exposure to
these potentially carcinogenic compounds. Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was
used as an additive to replace lead in gasoline, but its use was banned after
widespread ground water contamination was discovered.

Inhalation is the most common VOC route of exposure in the general population,
including indoor sources such as paints, adhesives, cleaning solutions, and
aerosolized insecticide sprays; industries producing these solvents; and
contaminated waste disposal sites. Drinking water may contribute to exposure
when underground drinking water supplies are contaminated. After they are
absorbed in the body, VOCs are rapidly eliminated in exhaled breath, or may be
rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-half sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

An automated analytical method was developed using capillary gas
chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS) with selected-ion monitoring
(SIM) detection and isotope-dilution. This method quantifies levels of
individual VOCs and Trihalomethanes (THMs) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE)
in whole blood to low-parts-per-trillion range. Because non-occupationally
exposed individuals have blood VOC concentrations within this range, this
method is applicable for determining these quantities and investigating cases
of sustained or recent low-level exposure.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) & Trihalomethanes/MTBE Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/VOCWB-J-
MET-508.pdf) (October 2020)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
(LPM). Vials are stored under appropriate refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions
until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for
testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Services' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for details
on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Volatile Toxicant Questionnaire**

** ** A volatile toxicant questionnaire (VTQ) was administered on the mobile
examination center (MEC), by trained interviewers, using the Computer-Assisted
Personal Interview (CAPI) system. The VTQ section includes data about the
participant's home, activities, amount of time spent in various locations, and
exposure to different chemicals over the past 48 hours. This questionnaire
data can be used in conjunction with the VOC laboratory dataset and found in
the Volatile Toxicant Data File in the [NHANES 2017-2018 Questionnaire
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2017)
section.

**Subsample Weights**

Whole blood VOCs were measured in a one-half subsample of participants 12
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-2018 Demographics
File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/FASTQX_J.htm)file includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBD2DFLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
LBD2DFLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBX2DF) provides the
analytic result for that analyte. All data are rounded to three significant
figures or three decimal places, whichever is less precise.
