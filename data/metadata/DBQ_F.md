### Diet Behavior & Nutrition (DBQ_F)

####  Data File: DBQ_F.xpt

##### First Published: September 2012

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Diet Behavior and Nutrition (variable name prefix DBQ) section provides
personal interview data on various dietary behavior and nutrition related
topics. Many of the questions were included in NHANES II (1976-80), Hispanic
HANES (1982-84), NHANES III (1988-94), and NHANES 1999-2008. Topics included
in the section are:  
  

  * Breastfeeding and other childhood feeding practices (<=**** 6 yr) 
  * Current milk consumption pattern and types of milk (>=**** 1 yr) 
  * Milk consumption pattern throughout the life span (>= 20 yr) 
  * Community or government meal program participation (>= 60 yr) 
  * School meal program participation (4-19 yr) 
  * Self-appraised healthfulness level of oneâs own diet (>=**** 16 yr) 
  * Frequency of getting meals prepared away from home (>= 1 yr) 
  * Frequency of meals got from fast-food or pizza places (>= 1 yr) 
  * Use of convenience foods (>= 1 yr) 
  * Self-perceived vegetarian (>= 1 yr) 
  * Food allergy (>=**** 1 yr) 
  * Meal planner/shopper/preparer status (>= 16 yr)  

Starting 2009, breastfeeding related questions in the DBQ section were revised
based on the 2006 National Immunization Survey (NIS). These revised questions
have been through extensive cognitive testing conducted by NIS in 2004-2005.
Most current CDC recommendations discourage introducing any milk other than
breast milk or iron-fortified infant formula to infant less than 12 month old.
The revised breastfeeding questions are more specific in capturing the first
introduction of anything other than breast milk. Therefore, they will improve
the validity of the measure of excusive breastfeeding. Please refer to the CDC
breastfeeding website for more information on NIS breastfeeding questions:
<http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/NIS_data/survey_methods.htm>

In addition,âSoy milkâ was added to the response categories for type of
milk questions (i.e., DBQ073 and DBQ223) to reflect the current market and
consumer behaviors.



Changes to the breastfeeding related questions 2007-2008 | 2009-2010  
---|---  
DBD010: Was {SP} ever breastfed or fed breastmilk? | Same as 2007-2008

DBQ072: What type of milk was {SP} first fed on a daily basis? Was it whole or regular, 2% fat or reduced-fat milk, 1% fat or low-fat milk (includes 0.5% fat milk or âlow-fat milkâ not further specified), fat-free, skim or nonfat milk, or an other type? | Renamed as DBQ073 with a new response category, âsoy milkâ, added  
DBD080: How old was {SP} when {he/she} started eating solid foods [such as strained foods like baby food or any other non-liquid foods] on a daily basis? | Replaced with DBD055 (see above)  
  
The Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module was first added to the
NHANES in 2007. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic
Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It is
designed to collect information on peopleâs knowledge, attitudes, and
beliefs toward nutrition and food choices. The FCBS module has two elements: a
core set of questions asked in the household interview, and a supplementary
module asked in a telephone follow-up interview with focuses specifically
designed for each 2-year data collection cycle.

The core set of the FCBS module collects information on individual
participantâs food choices, such as getting meals prepared away from home,
meals got from fast-food or pizza places, use of convenience foods or ready-
to-eat meals bought in stores, and participantâs self-perceived vegetarian
status, food allergy, and meal planner/shopper/preparer status at home. These
data are included as part of the present DBQ section.

The core set of the FCBS module also includes questions at participantâs
family level.  For example, family memberâs use of special diet,
availability of certain type of foods in the family, food expenditures, as
well as time spent on food shopping and cooking dinner, and meals eaten
together in the family. These family level questions, in the core set of the
FCBS module, are included in the Consumer Behavior (CBQ) section and will be
released in a separate file.

Data from the phone follow-up FCBS supplementary module will also be released
in separate files and made available on the NHANES website. Similar to other
datasets in the NHANES 2009-2010 release cycle, all FCBS related data files
can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). The complete
[2009-2010 FCBS
questionnaire](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/questionnaires/fcbs_f.pdf)
is available at the NHANES website. For more information on the other FCBS
related data, refer to the documentations accompanying the datasets.

## Eligible Sample

The target age groups for questions in this section vary by the topic. For
example, the questions pertaining to infant nutrition and breast-feeding were
asked of proxy respondents for children 6 years of age and younger; and senior
meal program participation questions were asked of respondents 60 years of age
and older. Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency
counts were verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

Questions on the frequencies of getting meals prepared away from home
(DBD895), meals got from fast-food or pizza places (DBD900), and use of
convenience foods (DBD905 and DBD910) were asked of participants 12-15 years
old, at the mobile examination center (MEC), using the Audio Computer Assisted
Self Interviewing (A-CASI) system. The same questions were asked of
participants 1-11 years and of participants 16 years and older, in the home,
by trained interviewers using the Computer Assisted Personal Interviewing
(CAPI) system. All other questions in this section were asked in the home, as
well.

Hand cards showing response categories were also used for some questions. When
necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to respondents. Persons 16
years of age and older and emancipated minors were interviewed directly. A
proxy provided information for survey participants who were under 16 years of
age and for individuals who could not answer the questions themselves

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data was reviewed by
the NHANES field office staff for accuracy and completeness.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, âskipâ patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some
variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of
the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure
concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing
process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e. DBQ)
to a D (i.e. DBD). For example, some data were collected using two variables
(a number variable and a unit of measure variable), but combined into a single
variable for data release purposes.

**DBD020, DBD030, DBD041, DBD050, DBD055, and DBD061** (Breastfeeding and
other childhood feeding practices)

This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to
allow respondents to report the age of interest in days, weeks, months, or
years. The released variables were edited to standardize the reported age to
number of days, using the following conversion factors: 7 days/week, 30.4
days/month and 365 days/year.

**DBD895** (Frequency of getting meals prepared away from home)  
Respondents were asked how many times they had gotten meals that were prepared
away from home in the past 7 days. If the frequency was reported as "never,"
the value was re-coded as zero. If the frequency was reported more than 21
times per week, the value was re-coded as â5555.â

**DBD900** (Frequency of getting meals from fast food or pizza places)  
Respondents were asked how many times they had gotten meals from fast food or
pizza places in the past 7 days. If the frequency was reported as "never," the
value was re-coded as zero. If the frequency was reported more than 21 times
per week, the value was re-coded as â5555.â

**DBD905 and DBD910** (Use of convenience foods)

This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to
allow respondents to report the frequency of interest as either per day, per
week, or per month. The released variables were edited to standardize the
reported frequency to number of times in the last 30 days. If the frequency
was reported as "never," the value was re-coded as zero.

## Analytic Notes

**DBD895, DBD900, DBD905, and DBD910** (Frequency of getting meals prepared
away from home, frequency of meals got from fast-food or pizza places, and use
of convenience foods)  
These questions were asked as part of household interview for participants
1-11 (proxy interview used) and 16 or more years of age, the interview sample
weights may be used in their analysis. However, if the data is joined with
other data from the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), the MEC sample weights
should be used. Analysis of these questions for 12 to 15 year olds should use
the MEC sample weights because the questions were asked in the MEC for this
age group.

Please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines and the on-line NHANES Tutorial
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
Both of these are available on the NHANES website.
