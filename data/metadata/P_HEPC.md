## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic infection with
these viruses, information about the prevalence of these diseases is needed to
monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally representative sample of
the U.S. population, NHANES provides the most reliable estimates of age-
specific prevalence needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies to
prevent these infections. In addition, NHANES provides the means to better
define the epidemiology of other hepatitis viruses. NHANES testing for markers
of infection with hepatitis viruses is used to determine secular trends in
infection rates across most age and racial/ethnic groups and provide a
national picture of the epidemiologic determinants of these infections (MMWR,
1998; MMWR, 2012).

In 2013, CDC revised its guidelines for Hepatitis C (HCV) testing because of
1) changes in the availability of certain commercial HCV antibody tests; 2)
evidence that many persons who are identified as reactive by an HCV antibody
test might not subsequently be evaluated to determine if they have current HCV
infection; and 3) there have been significant advances in the development of
antiviral agents with improved efficacy against HCV (Moyer, 2013).

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA)**

The COBAS AMPLICOR HCV MONITOR Test, version 2 0 (v2.0) is an in vitro nucleic
acid amplification test for the quantitation of Hepatitis C Virus RNA in human
serum or plasma on the COBAS AMPLICOR Analyzer.

**Hepatitis C Confirmed Antibody (INNO-LIA)**

In 2013, there was a change to the HCV testing algorithm. The flow chart for
the HCV testing algorithm can be found in the laboratory method file or by
following the MMWR link: <https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm62e0507a2.pdf>.

Samples found reactive to the HCV antibody screening test are tested for HCV
RNA. All HCV RNA positive samples were tested for HCV genotype, and only HCV
RNA negative samples were tested with an HCV antibody confirmation test.

For the antibody confirmation test, the manual 16-hour sample incubation test
procedure is used, where 10ul of specimens and controls are diluted in 1mL
diluent in test troughs to ensure test strips will slide easily and remain
submerged during incubation. Specimens and controls are incubated with
agitation by rocker at 34 rpm overnight (16±2 hours) at room temperature
(18-25°). After a 3X/5min each wash step on microtiter plate shaker, conjugate
is added with a 30-minute incubation at room temperature, followed by
aspiration, 3X/5min each wash step and 30-minute incubation in substrate
solution also on microtiter plate shaker. Finally, strips are agitated with
stop solution for 10-30 minutes at room temperature. The microtiter plate
shaker is set for 160 rpm and used for all the washes and solution
incubations. Strips are then dried completely in a dry incubator at 37°C for
30 minutes then mounted on the line immunoassay score data reporting sheet
with inverted tape for reading within one hour using the reading card. The
strips have lines for a background control, three reference lines for antibody
(level ±, human IgG, weak positive; level 1+ human IgG, moderate positive; and
level 3+, anti-human Ig, strong positive), and six lines for HCV antigens (C1,
C2, E2, NS3, NS4, and NS5). Samples with a positive antibody confirmation test
result are reported as positive. Samples with a negative antibody confirmation
test result are reported as negative. Samples with an indeterminate antibody
confirmation test result are released as missing. Only specimens insufficient
in quantity are deemed indeterminate (WHO, 2015).****

**Hepatitis C genotype**

HCV-RNA positive samples were then tested with a line probe assay to determine
the HCV genotype.

The VERSANT ® HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay (LiPA) is a line probe assay designed to
identify Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes. Six genotypes (1-6), and three
subtypes for genotype 1 (1a-b and 1-undertermined) can be identified in human
serum or EDTA plasma samples. Genotype information is available in the
majority of cases, including undetermined genotype. Genotype 1 is the most
prevalent genotype in the U.S.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Method Files

The method file will be available soon.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [2017-2018
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPMs).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they were
shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral
Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
Laboratory Data Overview documents for general information on NHANES
laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in the 2017-March 2020 approximately
76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [ NHANES 2017-March 2020
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. This data is qualitative. The
use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not applicable.
