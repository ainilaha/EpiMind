### Mental Health - Depression Screener (DPQ_G)

####  Data File: DPQ_G.xpt

##### First Published: September 2013

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a
nine-item screening instrument that asked questions about the frequency of
symptoms of depression over the past 2 weeks. A final follow-up question
assessed the overall impairment of the depressive symptoms. Response
categories for the nine-item instrument "not at all," "several days," "more
than half the days" and "nearly every day" were given a point ranging from 0
to 3.

## Eligible Sample

Mobile Examination Center (MEC) participants 12 years and older were eligible.
No proxies were permitted to answer these questions. Only data from
participants aged 18 years and older are included in this data file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked  by trained interviewers in Spanish or English
using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system during the MEC
private interview.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

 The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness
of the data.

## Analytic Notes

A total score is based on the sum of the points in each item ranging from from
0 to 27. Major depression and depression severity can also be assessed.

The NHANES full sample 2-Year MEC Exam Weights (WTMEC2YR) should be used to
analyze the 2011-2012.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
