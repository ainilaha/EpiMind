### Osteoporosis (OSQ_C)

####  Data File: OSQ_C.xpt

##### First Published: April 2006

##### Last Revised: July 2006

## Component Description

The Osteoporosis section (OSQ) provides personal interview data on the
following:

  * Doctor told participant s/he had fractured hip, wrist, or spine 
  * Number of times hip, wrist, or spine was fractured 
  * Age at each hip, wrist, or spine fracture 
  * Amount of trauma causing each hip, wrist or spine fracture 
  * Whether the participant has ever been diagnosed as having osteoporosis 
  * If diagnosed with osteoporosis, whether s/he has been treated for it. 

Many of the questions in this section also were included in the NHANES III:
1988-94 questionnaire under Musculoskeletal Conditions.

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for this section is participants 20 years and older.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

Household in-person.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The Osteoporosis questionnaire data was systematically reviewed for logical,
processing, and data input errors on a periodic basis during the process of
data collection.

The computer CAPI system had built-in consistency checks, online information
screens that provided the interviewers with information about the terms used
in the questionnaires, and hard and soft edit checks to reduce the number of
keying entry errors. All of the interviews were reviewed by the NHANES field
office staff for accuracy and completeness.

## Data Processing and Editing

The maximum number of hip fractures reported was 2; the maximum number of
wrist fractures was 6; the maximum number of spine fractures was 10.

Responses to OSD030a (How old were you when you fractured your hip?), OSD030b
(How old were you when you fractured your wrist?), and OSD030c (How old were
you when you fractured your spine?) were top coded at 85 years for consistency
with the top-coded age of the sample person.

If all ages reported by sample persons for a fracture {1st time, 2nd time, â€¦}
were less than 50 years in OSQ030a and OSQ040a, OSQ030b and OSQ040b, or
OSQ030c or OSQ040c, then the associated variables OSQ050a, OSQ050b, or OSQ050c
were not included in the OSQ_C data file or codebook.

## Analytic Notes

Appropriate sample weights: interview weights.

Although these data were collected as part of the household questionnaire, if
they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used for
the analyses.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues at
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx>.

The OSQ data are publicly available at
<https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm>.
