### Hepatitis B Surface Antibody (HEPB_S_E)

## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the
United States.

Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and control of
hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic
infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of these
diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally
representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide the most
reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will
be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 2 years and older are eligible to be tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Blood specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for Infectious Diseases, National Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Detailed instructions on specimen collection
and processing can be found on the NHANES website.

The VITROS Anti-HBs Quantitative assay is performed using the VITROS Anti-HBs
Quantitative Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HBs
Calibrators on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic System.

An immunometric technique is used. This involves the reaction of anti-HBs in
the sample with HBsAg (ad and ay subtypes) coated onto the wells. A
horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled HBsAg conjugate (ad and ay subtypes) then
complexes with the bound anti-HBs forming an "antigen sandwich." Unbound
materials are removed by washing.

A reagent containing luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a
peracid salt) and an electron transfer agent, is added to the wells. The HRP
in the bound conjugate catalyzes the oxidation of the luminol derivative,
producing light. The electron transfer agent increases the level and duration
of the light produced. The light signals are read by the VITROS ECi/ECiQ
Immunodiagnostic System. The amount of HRP conjugate bound is directly
proportional to the concentration of anti-HBs present.

There were changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment and lab
methods.

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the General Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
Description of Laboratory Methodology section above.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the General
Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed QA/QC protocols. A detailed
description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures can be
found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. They also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups. The
phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may
be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the Analytic
Guidelines for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues. The Analytic Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
