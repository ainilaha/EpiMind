### Pesticides - Organochlorine Pesticides - Pooled Samples (PSTPOL_F)

####  Data File: PSTPOL_F.xpt

##### First Published: September 2017

##### Last Revised: November 2020

## Component Description

Organochlorine pesticides are a diverse group of synthetic chemicals that
persist in the environment and tend to bioaccumulate. Most of these chemicals
have been banned from use in the U.S. Assessment of exposure to persistent
organochlorine pesticides in a representative sample of the U.S. population is
needed to determine current prevalence and level of exposure and the potential
for human health effects from exposure to these chemicals.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum samples from NHANES 2009-2010 were stored frozen before analysis. Eight
organochlorine pesticides and metabolites were measured in serum through the
use of automated liquid/liquid extraction and subsequent sample clean-up.
Final determination of target analytes was performed by isotope dilution gas
chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry GC/IDHRMS. The analytical
method is described in Jones et al, 2012, which is a modification of the
method described by Sjodin et al., 2004.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2009-2010 cycle.

Pesticides](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/labmethods/PSTPOL_F.pdf)
(September 2017)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedure Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf). Vials
are stored under appropriate frozen (-30oC) conditions until they are shipped
to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2009-2010 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Organochlorine pesticides were measured in a one-third subsample of
participants 12 years and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

Samples were pooled in groups of 8 samples per pool within 40 demographic
groups. The analysis of NHANES 2009-2010 pooled-sample data must be conducted
with the basic demographic variables provided in this data file. This pooled-
sample data file cannot be linked to other NHANES 2009-2010 data. Because each
sample person does not have an equal probability of selection, sample
weighting is needed to produce correct population estimates of means,
percentiles, and other descriptive statistics.

The pooled-sample weights required to produce estimates from these data are
included in this data file. The analysis of pooled-samples from survey data is
a relatively new field of study, and there is currently no established method
to produce design effect adjusted variance estimates for these pooled results.
These data cannot be analyzed using software designed for complex surveys
because design features are not available.

**Rationale and Methods Used to Create Pooled Results**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides an ongoing
assessment of the US population's exposure to environmental chemicals by using
biomonitoring in conjunction with CDC's National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of
concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the US
population is a primary objective of CDC's biomonitoring program.
Historically, this characterization has been based on individual measurements
of these compounds in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the
population. Pooling samples allows for larger sample volumes which can result
in lower limits of detection and reduces the number of measurements and costs.
In NHANES 2009-2010, a weighted pooled-sample design was implemented to
facilitate pooling samples before making analytical measurements. Table 1
lists the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names,
common abbreviation, and NHANES variable name for the analytes included in
this data file.

Pools were prepared from serum collected from a random one-third subset of the
NHANES 2009-2010 participants aged 12 years and older. Samples were pooled
based on gender, race and Hispanic origin, and age. To implement the pooled-
sample design, each participant sample was identified as belonging to one of
40 demographic groups based on race and Hispanic origin (Mexican American: MA,
Other Hispanic: OH, non-Hispanic white: NHW, non-Hispanic black: NHB, Other
race including multiracial: OTHER), gender (Male, Female), and age group
(12-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years of age and older). Eight (8) samples were
included in each pool. The number of pools created for each of the 40
demographic groups varied depending on the total number of individual samples
available in a demographic group. The one-third subset of NHANES 2009-2010
represents 2524 individual samples, but because the pooled-sample design
requires that all samples be of sufficient volume and that there be the same
number of samples in each pool, 2322 samples were available to create 301
pools with 8 samples per pool (Exceptions are in Table 2). The variable
SAMPLEID denotes the identification number for each pool and ranges from 1
through 303, excluding the numbers 265 and 266. Please refer to the Pooled-
Sample Technical Support file (POOLTF_F) for detailed information on
individual participants included in each pool.

In order to incorporate sample weighting into the pooled-sample design it was
necessary to use a different volume of material from each sample contributing
to a pool. The volume chosen for each sample in a pool was based on the ratio
of its sampling weight to the sum of the sampling weights of all samples in
the pool. To physically accomplish the pooling in the laboratory required that
the ratio of the largest to the smallest sampling weight of samples in the
same pool be no larger than about 4 or 5. The individual samples were
sorted/stratified by sampling weight within each of the 40 demographic groups
and pools were formed using samples with sampling weights adjacent to one
another in the sorted list. The number of samples in the one-third subset,
number of samples available, the number of these samples that were usable, and
the number of pools formed in each demographic group are presented in Table 2.
Once the pools were created, summed sampling weights were further adjusted to
account for the unused samples. These adjusted summed sampling weights are
represented by the variable named WTSMSMPA.

**Detection Limits**

In the dataset, the whole-weight detection limit (pg/g serum) is a variable
and dependent on the available sample size; however, the variation in sample
size was low. Lipid adjusted detection limits are variable (ng/g lipid) due to
differences of the lipid levels measured in individual pools/specimens. In
cases where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that
variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of 2.

**Methodological approaches for analysis**

There are a few pooled-sample methodological publications, which address
approaches related to the following topics:

  * Variance estimation and bias correction when pooling samples from log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2010b; Caudill et al., 2007; Li et al., 2014; Mary-Huard et al., 2007); 
  * Models that incorporate measurement error when analyzing pooled-samples from normally or log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2015); 
  * Incorporation of sample weighting into a pooled-sample design (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a); and 
  * Estimation of standard errors and confidence limits for point estimates from pooled-samples (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a).
