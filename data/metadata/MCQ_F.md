### Medical Conditions (MCQ_F)

####  Data File: MCQ_F.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2011

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The medical conditions section (prefix MCQ) provides self-reported personal
interview data on a broad range of health conditions for both children and
adults. The NHANES MCQ questionnaire section is generally modeled on the
"Medical Conditions" questionnaire section of the U.S. National Health
Interview Survey.

**Major Topics in the MCQ Section**

Health Conditions / Medical History:

  * Asthma, Childhood and Adult 
  * Anemia 
  * Psoriasis 
  * Heart Diseases 
  * Arthritis 
  * Blood Transfusions 
  * Cancer (Multiple varieties) 
  * Chronic Bronchitis 
  * Gout 
  * Emphysema 
  * Liver Disease 
  * Celiac Desease

## Eligible Sample

The target samples for questions in this section vary by age and gender.
Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency counts were
verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. The survey
questionnaire can be found at the NHANES website
<https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm>.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed and edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical
values.

## Analytic Notes

A number of additional questions occur in MCQ that are logically related to
other questionnaire sections or exam segments. Analysts should refer to these
other NHANES sections as part of any data analysis.  
Although these data were collected as part of the household questionnaire, if
they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used for
the analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
