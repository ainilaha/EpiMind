## Component Description

**HDL-Cholesterol**

The goals of this component are:

  1. to monitor the prevalence and trends in major cardiovascular conditions and risk factors in the U.S.; and 
  2. to evaluate prevention and treatment programs targeting cardiovascular disease in the U.S. 

The main element of the cardiovascular disease laboratory component in NHANES
is blood lipid levels. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in
the United States. The data will be used to monitor the status of
hyperlipidemia and the success of the National Cholesterol Education Program.

## Eligible Sample

Participants agedÂ 6 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria were sampled.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**HDL-CholestorolÂ**

**Data Collection Methods**

In the mobile examination center (MEC) laboratory, blood specimens are
processed, stored, and shipped to the Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein
Analytical Laboratory for analysis.

**Examination Protocol**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are described in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials were
stored under appropriate temperature conditions (stored at -20 degrees
Centigrade) until they were shipped to Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein
Analytical Laboratory for testing. The analytical methods are described in the
Analytic Methodology section of this document.

**Data Collection**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
LPM. Each chapter in the LPM specifies the procedure to be used for
preparation, labeling, processing, preservation, and transport of the
specimens.

**Analytic Methodology**

**HDL-Cholesterol Direct Immunoassay Method**

HDL is measured directly in serum. The apolipoprotein B containing
lipoproteins in the specimen are reacted with a blocking reagent that renders
them non-reactive with the enzymatic cholesterol reagent under conditions of
the assay. The reagents are purchased from Roche/Boehringer-Mannheim
Diagnostics. The method uses sulfated alpha-cyclodextrin in the presence of
Mg+2 , which forms complexes with apoB containing lipoproteins, and
polyethylene glycol-coupled cholesteryl esterase and cholesterol oxidase for
the HDL-cholesterol measurement. The reactions are as follows:

ApoB containing lipoproteins + a-cyclodextrin + Mg+2 \+ dextran SO4 \--->
soluble non-reactive complexes with apoB-containing lipoproteinsÂ

There was a change in the equipment from the Hitachi 717 to the Hitachi 912
during 2005-2006. The lab method was similar and the lab site was the same for
HDL Cholesterol in NHANES 2003-2004. A detailed description of the laboratory
method used can be found in Laboratory Procedures Manuals on the NHANES web
site.

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to Johns Hopkins Hospital,
Baltimore, MD for analysis. Detailed specimen collection and processing
instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists
Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data processing and
editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the Description of
the Laboratory Methodology section.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found on
the NHANES web site.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols. A detailed description of the QA/QC procedures
can be found on the NHANES web site.

## Analytic Notes

**Analytical Note**

**Change in Assay Methods Most Likely Responsible for Changes in HDL
Cholesterol values in NHANES 1999-2008**  
  
Researchers are cautioned to interpret trends in HDL cholesterol for NHANES
1999-2008 in view of probable HDL cholesterol method effects. The mean HDL
cholesterol values from 1999-2008 showed changes for sample participants 20
years or older:

Mean HDL Cholesterol Values from 1999-2008 Years | n | Mean HDL(mg/dL)* | SEM**  
---|---|---|---  
1999-2000 | 4117 | 50.6 | 0.7  
2001-2002 | 4691 | 51.9 | 0.28  
2003-2004 | 4475 | 54.1 | 0.38  
2005-2006 | 4481 | 54.6 | 0.36  
2007-2008 | 5332 | 51.9 | 0.53

The changes in average HDL Cholesterol levels from 1999-2008 were seen across
various age, gender and race-ethnicity groups indicating a method effect. The
HDL cholesterol was analyzed in 1999-2002 using two methods - heparin
manganese precipitation and a direct HDL immunoassay depending on the
participant age and amount of specimen. Most participants in 1999-2002 were
measured by the precipitation method. Starting in 2003, all HDL cholesterol
samples were analyzed using the direct HDL cholesterol immunoassay method. The
heparin-manganese precipitation method and direct immunoassay method for
1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2005-2006 showed an undesirable bias (>4%) when
compared to the laboratory's HDL-cholesterol quality controls (Solomon Park
Research Laboratories, Kirkland, WA) that were assigned values established by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC HDL cholesterol
reference method uses heparin-manganese to precipitate HDL-cholesterol and the
Abell-Kendall method to measure cholesterol. The HDL cholesterol for
1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2005-2006 were adjusted using:

Corrected HDL =Â Â Â Â Â Â (Solomon Park assigned HDL value) x (Participant
HDL)Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Quality Control HDL
value associated with Participant sample)

The bias for the HDL cholesterol method for 2003-2004 was acceptable (<4%) and
the participant results were not corrected. In addition, there was a change in
instrumentation in 2005-2006 and there were several modifications of the
direct HDL cholesterol method. To control for these differences in methods and
instrumentation, the HDL cholesterol was corrected using the Solomon Lab
quality controls as described above. In 2007-2008, a new laboratory performed
the HDL cholesterol using a direct HDL cholesterol method similar to the
direct HDL method of 2005-2006, but it was performed on a different
instrument.  
  
Both laboratories performing HDL Cholesterol from 1999-2008 participated in
the CDC-NHLBI Lipid Standardization Program (LSP). The CDC LSP maximum
allowable bias for HDL Cholesterol is 5%. The average bias compared to the
reference CDC HDL Cholesterol value for 2007-2008 was approximately -0.5%. The
average bias compared to the CDC HDL Cholesterol values for 2003-2004 and
2005-2006 were approximately +2.7% and +2.0%, respectively. Unfortunately, the
HDL Cholesterol values for the LSP program for 1999-2002 could not be
evaluated. This indicates that the 2007-2008 HDL Cholesterol values may be
less biased than the 2003-2006 values; however, both laboratories were within
the 5% maximum allowable bias for HDL Cholesterol.  
  
The changes in average HDL Cholesterol levels from 1999-2008 were seen across
various age, gender and race-ethnicity groups indicating a method effect.
Other covariates (body mass index, medications, physical exercise, smoking and
alcohol consumption) may explain some of the changes in HDL cholesterol, but
it is unlikely to account for the majority of the mean changes in HDL
cholesterol.

Derived variables were created in this data file. The derivations follow:

LBDHDDSI:  
The HDL-cholesterol in mg/dL (LBXHDD) was converted to mmol/L (LBDHDDSI) by
multiplying by 0.02586.

LBDHDD:  
The corrected HDL as described inÂ the above Analytical Note.Â

In cases where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that
variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of two.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the Analytic
Guidelines for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues.Â The Analytic Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
