### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) - Water (VOC_F)

####  Data File: VOC_F.xpt

#####  First Published: August 2017

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

****Volatile Organic Compounds  (Home Tap Water) \- Trihalomethanes/MTBE**  
**  
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large group of chemicals that have
been used as solvents, degreasers, and cleaning agents in industry and
consumer products. Many of the VOCs were found to contaminate ground water and
drinking water sources, and because of human health concerns, have been banned
or restricted from most uses.

The prevalence of disinfection by-products in drinking water supplies has
raised concerns about possible adverse health effects from chronic exposure to
these potentially carcinogenic compounds. Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was
used as an additive to replace lead in gasoline, but its use was banned after
widespread ground water contamination was discovered.

Inhalation is the most common VOC route of exposure in the general population.
Primary indoor sources of exposure are paints, adhesives, cleaning solutions,
and aerosolized insecticide sprays. Other sources are industries producing
these solvents and contaminated waste disposal sites. Drinking water may
contribute to exposure when underground drinking water supplies are
contaminated. After they are absorbed in the body, VOCs are rapidly eliminated
in exhaled breath, or may be rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine.

In addition to assessing levels of VOCs in blood, VOC levels were measured in
home tap water specimens provided by NHANES participants. Specifically,
trihalomethanes (THMs) and the fuel additive MTBE are measured in these
samples.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and older from a one-half sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Measurements of Trihalomethanes (THMs) and MTBE in Tap Water**

This automated analytical method uses headspace solid-phase microextraction
(SPME) coupled with capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry
(Cardinali et al. 2004). This method quantitated trace levels of THMs
(chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) and
MTBE in tap water. Detection limits of less than 0.15 ng/mL for all analytes
and linear ranges of three orders of magnitude are adequate for measuring the
THMs in tap water samples tested from across the United States. THMs are
stable for extended periods in tap water samples after quenching of residual
chlorine and buffering to pH 6.5, thus enabling larger epidemiologic field
studies with simplified sample collection protocols.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

**** There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for
this component in the NHANES 2009-2010 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

Water](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/labmethods/VOC_F_MET.pdf)
(August 2017)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Water samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf). Vials
are stored under appropriate refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions until they are
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the CDC/NCEH Tobacco and Volatile Branch quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2009-2010 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2010)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Volatile Toxicant Questionnaire**

A volatile toxicant questionnaire (VTQ) was administered on the mobile
examination center (MEC), by trained interviewers, using the Computer-Assisted
Personal Interview (CAPI) system. The VTQ section includes data about the SP's
home, activities, amount of time spent in various locations, and exposure to
different chemicals over the past 48 hours. This questionnaire data can be
used in conjunction with the VOC laboratory dataset and found in the Volatile
Toxicant Data File in the [NHANES 2009-2010 Questionnaire
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2009)
section.

**Subsample Weights**

Trihalomethanes (THMs) and MTBE were measured in a one-half subsample of
participants aged 12 years and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES Demographic
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2009)
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDWBFLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDWBFLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXWBF)
provides the analytic result for the analyte.
