### Taste & Smell (CSQ_H)

####  Data File: CSQ_H.xpt

#####  First Published: February 2016

#####  Last Revised: March 2016

## Component Description

The Taste and Smell Questionnaire Section (variable name prefix CSQ) collected
interview data on self-reported taste and smell ability, selected symptoms of
and medical treatment for taste and smell disorders, and data on conditions
that may represent risk factors for taste and smell disorders. The CSQ
questionnaire was designed to provide data to support the Healthy People 2020
objectives for taste and smell disorders (Healthy People, 2020).

## Eligible Sample

Adults of both genders ages 40+ years were eligible to participate. There were
no exclusions for the CSQ taste & smell questionnaire.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The 2013-14 NHANES taste and smell questionnaire data was verified against the
main data collection file prior to public release.

## Analytic Notes

These data were collected as a part of the NHANES Household Questionnaire
Interview. For data analysis, NHANES Household Interview weights should be
used if only questionnaire data is being studied. However, if CSQ
questionnaire data is merged with MEC examination or laboratory data, then
NHANES MEC examination weights should be used for the analyses (or if
applicable, subsample laboratory weights). Please refer to the NHANES Analytic
Guidelines and the on-line NHANES Tutorial for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.

The CSQ questionnaire was specially developed for NHANES use and had not been
previously used elsewhere. Despite prior cognitive testing of the instrument,
when the CSQ questionnaire was fielded, one question did not perform as
intended. CSQ030 was intended to capture a history of an altered, typically
unpleasant perception of smell in the presence of an ordinary odor (parosmia).
In the field most participants who answered "yes" to this question did not
believe that they had any problem with their ability to smell. However, CSQ030
was retained in the public data release because of the possibility that it
might have some analytic use where there was other questionnaire or
examination data to suggest an abnormality of smell.

Decreased taste and smell ability may be transient (for example, from a recent
temporary illness) or chronic. The variable CSQ070 captures this dimension for
abnormalities of smell. Duration of taste or smell symptoms is captured by the
variables CSQ140 and CSQ060, respectively. Taste and smell ability may be
adversely affected by a number of chronic health conditions and by the side
effects of prescription medications. A recently published community study
indicates that smoking may also adversely affect the ability to smell and
taste (Vennemann et al., 2008).

A number of NHANES 2013-14 datasets may be pertinent to the analysis of taste
and smell data. These include NHANES datasets on medical conditions (MCQ, KIQ,
DIQ, BPQ); blood sugar (BIOPRO, GHB); blood pressure (BPX); body weight (BMQ,
WHQ); diet and nutrition (DTQ, DRXDOC, DSQDOC, DBQ); smoking (SMQ, COTNAL);
osteoporosis (OSQ, DXX); oral health (OHXDEN, OHXPER); and prescription
medication use (RXQ_RX).

The variables CSQ200 through CSQ260 identify a history of some co-morbid
conditions not captured in other NHANES questionnaires that could potentially
affect taste and smell. These include the history of a recent prolonged head
cold or flu; persistent dry mouth; chronic nasal congestion resulting from
allergies; recurrent sinusitis, a history of tonsillectomy or of wisdom teeth
extraction; and loss of consciousness or nasal fracture due to head injury.
Also the AUQ_G Household Interview Audiometry questionnaire collected 2
additional questions: a history of repeated ear infections (AUQ136) and a
history of ear tube placement (AUQ138).

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
