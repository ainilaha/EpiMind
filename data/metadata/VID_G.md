### Vitamin D (VID_G)

####  Data File: VID_G.xpt

##### First Published: October 2017

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Vitamin D is functionally a hormone rather than a vitamin, and in conjunction
with parathyroid hormone and calcitonin, it is one of the most important
biological regulators of calcium metabolism. Vitamin D and its main
metabolites may be categorized into two families of secosteroids (steroid
B-ring open): cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and ergocalciferol (vitamin D2).
Both vitamins D3 and D2 are enzymatically hydroxylated in the liver to
25-hydroxy forms and then further metabolized in the kidney to the bioactive
1,25-dihydroxy forms.

Although 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) is not the bioactive form, it is the
predominant circulating form of vitamin D, and thus, it is considered to be
the most reliable index of vitamin D status (Olkowski, et al., 2003; Saenger,
et al., 2006). Vitamin D3 is a naturally occurring form of vitamin D that is
produced in the skin after 7-dehydrocholesterol is exposed to UV-B radiation.
Commercially, vitamin D2 is produced by UV irradiation of plant-derived
ergosterol. The two forms differ in the structures of their side chains, but
they are metabolized identically. Good sources of vitamin D3 are fatty fish
while mushrooms provide a good source of vitamin D2. Both forms are used for
fortification of a limited selection of foods including milk, juice,
margarines, cheese and nutrition bars.

These data will be used to estimate risks for deficiencies and toxicities of
specific nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population
reference data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and
other factors to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to
further define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease
prevention and health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 1 years and older.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The test principle utilizes ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) for the quantitative detection of
25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3), epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (epi-25OHD3), and
25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) in human serum. The analytes are
chromatographically separated generally on one of two pentaflurophenyl (PFP)
columns (Thermo Scientific Hypersil GOLD PFP 2.1 x 100 mm, 1.9 µm particle
size column or Phenomenex Kinetex PFP 2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 µm). Mobile phase
composition for optimized chromatography varies slightly for the two columns,
but is between 69% and 72% methanol in water. The composition of the solution
added to the serum during extraction, the solution used for reconstitution,
the needle wash, and the equilibration solution should match that used for the
mobile phase.

Serum samples are first treated by the addition of an ethanolic solution
containing three internal standards and a solution of 69-72% methanol followed
by the addition of hexane. Analytes are extracted from the aqueous phase into
the hexane layer (liquid-liquid extraction) which is dried under vacuum. The
extract is re-dissolved with 69-72% methanol. An aliquot of the extract is
injected onto the PFP column for the separation of 25OHD3, epi-25OHD3, 25OHD2,
and the internal standards (IS), 26,27-hexadeuterium-25-hydroxyvitamin D3,
6,19,19-trideuterium-3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and
6,19,19-trideuterium-25-hydroxyvitamin D2. Detection is performed by using MS-
MS on a Thermo TSQ Vantage system using atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization in the positive ion mode. Quantitation is accomplished by comparing
the peak area of the analyte in the unknown with the peak area of a known
amount of analyte in a calibrator solution. Calculations are corrected based
on the peak area of the internal standard in the unknown compared with the
peak area of the matched internal standard in the calibrator solution.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2011-2012 cycle.

(October 2017)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf://).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels are
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS periodically. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

In addition to total 25-Hydroxyvitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D2,
25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 are being released. Total
25-Hydroxyvitamin D is the sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin
D3, but excludes epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3.

Refer to the [2011-2012 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/FASTQX_G.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.  

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**  

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
The SAS variable name ending in LC (ex., LBXVD2LC) indicates whether the
result was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result
was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was
below the limit of detection. For analytes with analytic results below the
lower limit of detection (ex., LBXVIDLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed
in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection
divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt (2)). The other variable prefixed
LBX (ex., LBXVIDMS) provides the result for the analyte.

The lower limits of detection (LLOD in nmol/L) for Vitamin D metabolites are:

SAS Label |  SAS Variable |  LLOD  
---|---|---  
  25-hydroxyvitamin D2 |  LBXVD2MS |  2.05 nmol/L   
 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 |  LBXVD3MS |  2.23 nmol/L  
 epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 |  LBXVE3MS |  1.64 nmol/L  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Analysis of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Data from NHANES III (1988-1994) and NHANES
2001-2006, with NHANES data collected since 2007**

The LC-MS/MS-equivalent 25-Hydroxyvitamin D data are recommended for all
analyses, but especially for analyzing secular trends for serum vitamin D
involving NHANES III (1988-1994), NHANES 2001-2006 and NHANES data collected
since 2007. Users are strongly encouraged to review the [Analytical Note for
25-Hydroxyvitamin D Data Analysis
(cdc.gov)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/vitamind/analyticalnote.aspx?b=2009&e=2010&d=VID_F&x=XPT)
prior to the analysis.
