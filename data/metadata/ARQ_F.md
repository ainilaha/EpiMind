### Arthritis (ARQ_F)

####  Data File: ARQ_F.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2011

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Arthritis Questionnaire Section (prefix ARQ) provides interview data for
chronic back pain, Inflammatory Back Pain (IBP) and Spondyloarthritis (SpA or
Spinal Arthritis) related data. It was part of a one-time 2-year NHANES data
collection effort to obtain U.S. prevalence estimates for IBP and SpA, because
the national prevalence of these disorders had not been previously defined
(Helmick et al., 2008). In 2009-10, data was also collected for selected
arthritis-related body measures (ARX_F) and in 2009 for the HLA-B27 biomarker
(B27_F_R).

Inflammatory Back Pain is a specific syndrome of chronic back pain typically
occurring in younger adults. It usually has a gradual onset, and back pain
typically worsens with rest or immobility and improves with exercise or
activity. Prolonged spinal stiffness in the morning is common and the response
of back pain to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as
indomethacin, ibuprofen or naproxyn can be dramatic. IBP is one of the key
features of Spondyloarthritis.

Spondyloarthritis usually affects the low back, but also occurs elsewhere in
the spinal column (neck, upper and mid back, and sacroiliac joints [the
buttocks]). It may also affect other joints and tendon areas (hips, rib cage,
the heels, etc.). Certain medical conditions are indicators of, or risk
factors for Spinal Arthritis. These include Iritis (an inflammatory disease of
the eye) and both Ulcerative and Crohn's Colitis (inflammatory bowel
diseases). ARQ collects data on all the above conditions.

The ARQ Questionnaire has these sections:

  * The ARQ010 chronic back pain screening question to identify interviewees with chronic back pain 
  * The ARQ020a-f series of questions and the back pain diagram to identify the specific locations in the spine where an interviewee had pain 
  * The ARQ021-ARQ027 question series that captures additional detail about pain at each location:   
Whether there was specifically pain, aching and/or stiffness  
The age at onset of the symptoms  
Currently have or when last had symptoms  
Had a pain episode for more than 3 months  
The pattern of symptom onset (sudden, gradual, etc.)  
The day-to-day pattern of symptoms

  * The ARQ031/034 and ARQ040-ARQ100 question series. These questions were administered only to those who had a history of chronic spinal pain in the neck, upper, mid or low back or the buttocks. The series collects data on inflammatory back pain indicators:   
Response of pain to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs  
History of morning stiffness  
Pain pattern over the course of the day  
Pain pattern with sleep or rest  
Pain response to exercise  
History of alternating buttock (sacroiliac joint) pain

  * The ARQ110-ARQ125E question series to provide case definition data for spinal arthritis. They were administered to all eligible respondents: 
  * The ARQ110-112a-b heel pain questions and pain diagram to identify those with heel and/or Achilles tendon pain (additional detail captured in ARQ118AA-ARQ118BO). 
  * A history of medical conditions which are indicators of, or risk factors for Spinal Arthritis (ARD125A-ARQ125E). 



## Eligible Sample

The eligible sample was a full sample of U.S. adults ages 20-69 years. There
were no exclusions.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviews using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

Derived variables created for the dataset:

1\. Since Uveitis cases were only rarely noted in the 2009-10 data collection,
and the majority of these cases also said they had Iritis, these variables
were combined. The data for a history of Iritis (ARQ125A) and Uveitis
(ARQ125B) were merged into a single variable named ARD125A. The data for the
Iritis and Uveits "confirmation" questions ARQ130A and ARQ130B were merged
into a single variable named ARD130A. Iritis and Uveitis are medically very
similar inflammatory eye conditions.

2\. ARQ026 and ARQ027 represent a single question that captured data on the
day-to-day pattern of pain at a particular location. For the household
interview, two versions of the question were created for the convenience of
the interviewers and interviewees: one version being administered to those who
had currently had pain at that site, and a second version administered to
those who did not. The reason for this was that some response categories were
irrelevant to persons who did not currently have pain at that particular site.
For the ARQ public release, the data for these two questions at each location
on the pain diagram were merged back into a single variable. These are the
variables ARD026A through ARD026G.

3\. If a respondent stated they had a history of pain at the plantar aspect of
the heel or at the Achilles tendon area (diagram locations A and B,
respectively), then additional detail was captured to identify the nature of
the problem. This is the variable series ARQ118AA-ARQ118AO for location A and
ARQ118BA-ARQ118BO for location B. Some of these variables had very low
frequencies, so their data was merged with other variables in the series.
Specifically the variables for a history of injury or fracture were merged,
and the data for all other low frequency variables were recoded to "other"
(ARQ118AO or ARQ118BO=91). The household interview variables ARQ118af ARQ118ag
ARQ118ah ARQ118ai ARQ118ak ARQ118al and ARQ118bf ARQ118bg ARQ118bh ARQ118bi
ARQ118bk ARQ118bl were then deleted from the public release dataset.

## Analytic Notes

NHANES ARQ questionnaire items were selected to support prevalence estimation
for currently published Inflammatory Back Pain and Spondyloarthritis case
definitions (Amor et al. 1990; Calin et al., 1977; Dougados et al., 1991;
Rudwaleit et al., 2006; Rudwaleit et al., 2009; Sieper et al., 2009; Sieper et
al., 2009). Back pain and arthritis questionnaires from the medical literature
and from previous NHANES surveys were reviewed for possible questionnaire
items, question wording, and data formats. Preliminary data and focus group
results from an Ankylosing Spondylitis questionnaire were also available
(Weisman et al., 2010). A questionnaire was drafted, cognitively tested, then
revised and piloted tested in the field in 2008. It was then finalized based
on pilot study results and interviewer staff input.

A copy of the ARQ_F questionnaire is available at:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/questionnaires/arq_f.pdf>

A copy of the two pain diagram handcards (ARQ1 & ARQ4) is available at:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/questionnaires/sp_handcards_0910.pdf>

Related NHANES 2009-2010 Questionnaire Datasets:

Medical Conditions (MCQ) contains questionnaire data on a history of a
previous medical provider diagnosis of arthritis.

Physical Functioning (PFQ) contains data on functional physical limitations,
as well as information on the type of health problems (including arthritis)
causing the difficulty.

Prescription Medications (RXQ) contains data on all prescription medications
currently taken, including those for arthritis and musculoskeletal pain.

The ARQ questionnaire data were collected as part of the NHANES Household
Questionnaire Interview. NHANES Household Interview weights should be used if
only questionnaire data is analyzed. However, if ARQ_F questionnaire data is
merged with the MEC examination or laboratory data, then NHANES MEC
examination sample weights should be used for the analyses. Special replicate
weights should be used if ARQ_F data is merged with HLA-B27 data. (See
documentation for B27_F_R).

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
