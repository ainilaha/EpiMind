### Phytoestrogens - Urine (L06PHY_C)

####  Data File: L06PHY_C.xpt

#####  First Published: May 2009

#####  Last Revised: August 2009

## Component Description

Phytoestrogens are plant-derived polyphenolic compounds, such as isoflavones
and lignans that are structurally similar to endogenous estrogens (Cornwell,
et al. 2004). Phytoestrogens are capable of estrogen-receptor binding
(Cornwell et al., 2004) and may also influence other biologic pathways. The
consumption of diets high in phytoestrogen-rich foods has been associated with
lower rates of hormone-dependent cancers (Peeters et al., 2003; Adlercreutz et
al., 2002; Davis et al., 1999), improved bone health (Ma et al., 2007; Coxam
et al., 2003) and other healthy outcomes. Biomeasures of phytoestrogens are
necessary to establish reference ranges for these compounds and to evaluate
their potential effects on human health.



## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Phytoestrogen biomonitoring is accomplished by measuring several urinary
isoflavones (daidzein, genistein, equol, O-desmethylangolensin) and lignans
(enterodiol, enterolactone) of epidemiological significance using high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric
(MS/MS) detection (Rybal, M. E. et al., 2008). In brief, urine samples are
amended with stable-isotope labeled internal standards (to improve method
accuracy and precision), incubated with a deconjugation enzyme (so that the
"total" amount of each phytoestrogen can be measured), extracted using solid
phase extraction (to remove interferences and improve measurement sensitivity)
and analyzed using negative ion mode electrospray ionization HPLC-MS/MS (a
sensitive analysis technique with a high degree of analyte specificity).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.  
Analytical Laboratories

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision (similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary environmentals were measured in a one third subsample of
persons 6 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these
data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this
data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection.

The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
