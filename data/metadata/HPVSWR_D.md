### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA - Vaginal Swab: Digene Hybrid Capture &
Roche Linear Array (HPVSWR_D)

####  Data File: HPVSWR_D.xpt

##### First Published: November 2010

##### Last Revised: November 2018

## Component Description

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the most common sexually transmitted
infections in the United States. Cervical infection with certain types of HPV
is a major risk factor for cervical cancer in women. The "high-risk" types of
HPV (e.g., HPV 16, 18) are associated with cervical cancer and the "low-risk"
types (e.g., HPV 6, 11) with genital warts. No national surveillance system
exists to measure the full burden of HPV infection, and no reliable national
population estimate of HPV exists. NHANES offers a unique opportunity to
assess the prevalence of HPV infection in the general population.

Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Developmental Healthy People
2010 objective: "Reducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the
overall number of cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer
in females..." Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs (in
conjunction with testing of NHANES sera for HPV antibody) will allow
evaluation of trends in prevalence of type-specific HPV infection by age,
sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity. Two HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix)
are licensed and recommended for use in girls and women. Routine vaccination
is recommended for girls 11 or 12 years of age, and catch-up vaccination
through 26 years. One vaccine (Gardasil) is licensed and available for boys
and men. As vaccine becomes more widely used, the national prevalence of HPV
infection will be critical for evaluating vaccination strategies in the United
States.

## Eligible Sample

Examined female participants aged 14-59 years were eligible. This public data
file includes data for examined participants aged 18-59 years. Please see
_Analytic Notes_ about the release of data for adolescents aged 14-17 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test**

LBXH2RL (Hybrid Capture high risk result)  
LBXH3RL (Hybrid Capture low risk result)

The vaginal swab is extracted to obtain DNA. The DNA extracts are used in the
Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test. This test, using Hybrid Capture 2 technology, is a
nucleic acid hybridization microplate assay with signal amplification. It uses
chemiluminescence for the qualitative detection of eighteen types of human
papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical specimens. The hc2 HPV DNA Test can
differentiate between two HPV DNA groups: low-risk HPV types (LR) 6, 11, 42,
43, 44; and high/intermediate-risk HPV types (HR)16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45,
51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68. It cannot determine the specific HPV type present.

Specimens containing the target DNA hybridize with the HR or LR HPV RNA probe
cocktail. The resultant RNA: DNA hybrids are captured onto the surface of a
microplate well coated with antibodies specific for RNA: DNA hybrids.
Immobilized hybrids are then reacted with alkaline phosphatase conjugated
antibodies specific for the RNA: DNA hybrids, and detected with a
chemiluminescent substrate. As the substrate is cleaved by the bound alkaline
phosphatase, light is emitted which is measured as relative light units (RLUs)
on a luminometer. The intensity of the light emitted denotes the presence or
absence of target DNA in the specimen. An RLU measurement equal to or greater
than the Cutoff Value indicates the presence of HPV DNA sequences in the
specimen. An RLU measurement less than the Cutoff Value indicates the absence
of the specific HPV DNA sequences tested or HPV DNA levels below the detection
limit of the assay.

**Roche Linear Array Assay**

This assay uses Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping test that is based on HPV L1
consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with biotinylated PGMY09/11 primer
sets. It also includes biotinylated β-globin primers as an internal control
for sample amplification. The primer mix amplifies essentially all HPV types
found in the genital tract along with the human β-globin gene. After
amplification the samples are typed by hybridization to the typing strips
followed by colorimetric detection. The strip is a linear array of probes
specific for 37 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51,
52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81,
82, 83, 84, IS39, and 89) and for the positive β-globin control as well. Types
are read by comparing the reaction pattern to the typing template. Samples
that are negative for HPV and the β-globin control indicate lack of a suitable
sample and are considered inadequate for interpretation.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Vaginal swab samples were processed, stored and shipped to the Chronic Viral
Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology,
National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

The Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test is approved for clinical testing, but the self-
collected vaginal sample does not meet clinical guidelines. The HPV PCR tests
are research tests. The HPV laboratory followed strict research QC/QA and was
CLIA certified August 2008\. Detailed quality control and quality assurance
instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists
Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.
The analytical methods are described in the **Description of the Laboratory
Methodology** section.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf). Swabs
were stored at room temperature until they were shipped to the National Center
for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases for testing.

Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2005-2006 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2005)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Sample Weights**

MEC exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2005-2006 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2005-2006/DEMO_D.XPT) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data, health indicators,
and other related information collected during household interviews. Certain
sensitive data on participants under 18 years of age (e.g., HPV typing
results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files.
These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines.

The public release data file includes HPV vaginal swab data for participants
aged 18-59. HPV vaginal swab data for youth aged 14-17 years are available
through the [NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

**Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test**

An RLU measurement equal to or greater than the Cutoff Value of 1.0 indicates
the presence of HPV DNA sequences in the specimen. An RLU measurement less
than the Cutoff Value indicates the absence of the specific HPV DNA sequences
tested or HPV DNA levels below the detection limit of the assay.

**HPV PCR Assay**

**HPV Summary Variable**

The HPV PCR Summary variable (LBDRPCR) indicates if at least one type is
positive (LBDRPCR=1), the sample is negative (LBDRPCR=2), the sample is
inadequate (LBDRPCR=3), or the sample is missing (LBDRPCR=.).

If beta-globin is not present, both LBDRHP and LBDRLP are negative in the
sample and no HPV type is detected, the sample is coded as "Inadequate".

If any of the types on the strips (LBDR06-LBDRPI) are positive, the sample is
coded as positive. If all of the types on the strip are coded as negative, and
beta-globin is detected (either LBDRHP or LBDRLP is positive) the sample is
coded as negative.

Variables LBDRHP through LBDRPI are from the RUO Roche Linear Array HPV typing
assay, however LBDR52 also includes information from a type-specific assay for
HPV 52. The Linear Array typing strip includes an XR probe that hybridizes
with HPV 52 as well as HPV types 33, 35 and 58. Samples positive for the XR
probe and 33, 35, or 58 require specific testing to confirm the presence of
HPV 52.

**Detection Limits**

If data is qualitative, the use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
