### Organophosphate Insecticides - Dialkyl Phosphate Metabolites - Urine
(OPD_I)

####  Data File: OPD_I.xpt

##### First Published: August 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are used in both residential and agricultural
settings in the United States. OP pesticides include malathion, diazinon,
chlorpyrifos, Guthion® (azinphosmethyl), malathion, parathion, and many
others. All OP pesticides have a common mode of toxicity because they are
competitive inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for
deacetylation of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Koelle G.B., 1994)
(Gompertz D., 1996). Unfortunately, the toxic effects of OP pesticides are not
unique to insects; high doses can similarly affect wildlife and people.

OP pesticides were among the first of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)-registered pesticides whose food tolerances were reassessed (EPA, 2017),
due to their common mode of toxicity and potential adverse effects in
vulnerable populations, such as children.

Most of the organophosphate pesticides registered for use in the United States
by the EPA are O, O-dimethyl, or O-diethyl substituted, which metabolize to
dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites. The six common DAP metabolites
(Dimethylphosphate, Diethylphosphate, Dimethylthiophosphate,
Dimethyldithiophosphate, Diethylthiophosphate, and Diethyldithiophosphate) do
not retain any of the structure unique to the pesticides from which they were
derived, so it is impossible to identify individual pesticides from these
metabolites. However, because these metabolites are common to the majority of
OP pesticides, they can provide invaluable information about cumulative
exposure to the OP class.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The method uses solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with isotope dilution-
ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry
(Jayatilaka N.K., et. al., 2019). The method relies on an enzymatic hydrolysis
of urinary conjugates, automated off-line SPE to pre-concentrate the target
compounds while minimizing urine matrix potential interferences to increase
the overall sensitivity and specificity. The deconjugated target analytes in
the urine extract are separated on an UHPLC system with reversed phase
chromatography and quantified by isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, and lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Organophosphate Insecticides - Dialkyl Phosphate
Metabolites](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/labmethods/OPD-I-
MET-508.pdf) (August 2021)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM).](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they were
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Ftutorials%2Findex.htm)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Organophosphate Pesticides - Dialkyl Phosphate Metabolites were measured in a
one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights
are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File ](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.htm)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in this file.
URXUCR can be found in the data file titled "**Albumin & Creatinine -
Urine**".

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit was constant for the analyte in the data set. Two
variables are provided for this analyte. The variable name ending in "LC"
(ex., URDOP1LC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of detection,
"1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other
variable prefixed URX (ex., URXOP1) provides the analytic result for that
analyte. For the analyte with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (URDOP1LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for Organophosphate Pesticides -
Dialkyl Phosphate Metabolites:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD (ng/mL)**  
---|---|---  
URXOP1 |  Dimethylphosphate (ng/mL) |  0.1  
URXOP2 |  Diethylphosphate (ng/mL) |  0.1  
URXOP3 |  Dimethylthiophosphate (ng/mL) |  0.1  
URXOP4 |  Diethylthiophosphate (ng/mL) |  0.1  
URXOP5 |  Dimethyldithiophosphate (ng/mL) |  0.1  
URXOP6 |  Diethyldithiophosphate (ng/mL) |  0.1
