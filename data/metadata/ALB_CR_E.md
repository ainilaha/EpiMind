### Albumin & Creatinine - Urine (ALB_CR_E)

####  Data File: ALB_CR_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2009

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Urinary albumin is measured. Related survey questionnaire data include
information on analgesic product use and incontinence. Urinary creatinine is
measured. Urine creatinine concentrations from these specimens have been used
(instead of a 24-hour volume correction) to correct for the degree of dilution
or concentration of some of the urine analytes, such as the phenols or
microalbumin.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine specimens are processed, stored and shipped to University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN. Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are
discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).  
  
**Urinary albumin**  
  
A solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay for the measurement of human urinary
albumin is described by Chavers et al. (Chavers, BM, Kidney Int. 1984;
25:576-578). The fluorescent immunoassay is a non-competitive, double-antibody
method for the determination of human albumin in urine. Antibody to human
albumin is covalently attached to derivatized polyacrylamide beads. The solid-
phase antibody is reacted with a urine specimen, and the urine albumin-antigen
complexes with the solid-phase antibody. This complex then reacts with
fluorescein-labeled antibody. The unattached fluorescent antibody is then
removed by washing during centrifugation. The fluorescence of the stable
solid-phase antibody complex is determined with a fluorometer; the
fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of urine albumin present.
The standard curve is 0.5-20 μg/mL of albumin.  
  
Increased microalbuminuria is a sign of renal disease and may be predictive of
nephropathy risk in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Results of the
fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) are reproducible, and the test is accurate and
sensitive for the detection of human urinary albumin excretion. It is
especially useful for the measurement of low levels of urinary albumin not
detectable by dipstick methods. The FIA assay resembles the radio-immunoassay
(RIA) in technique and sensitivity without the potential health hazards
associated with the handling of isotopes in the laboratory (Chavers, BM,
Kidney Int. 1984; 25:576-578).  
  
**Urinary Creatinine using Beckman Synchron CX3 Clinical Analyzer**

Creatinine analysis uses a Jaffe rate reaction, in which creatinine reacts
with picrate in an alkaline solution to form a red creatinine-picrate complex.
The reaction is measured with a CX3 analyzer. The rate of the color
development is measured 25.6 sec after sample injection at 520 and 560 nm. The
rate difference between the two wavelengths is proportional to the
concentration of creatinine in the reaction cup. The procedures described
below are the standard protocols of the Fairview University Medical Center
(Creatinine Measurement Module Operating and Service Instructions, Beckman
ASTRA. Brea (CA): Beckman Instruments, Inc., 1979; Operating and Service

Creatinine, the waste product derived from creatine, is released into the
plasma at a relatively constant rate. The amount of creatinine per unit of
muscle mass is constant; therefore, creatinine is the best indicator of
impaired kidney function.

**Urinary Creatinine using Roche/Hitachi Modular P Chemistry Analyzer**

**  
** In this enzymatic method creatinine is converted to creatine under the
activity of creatininase. Creatine is then acted upon by creatinase to form
sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine oxidase converts sarcosine to glycine and
hydrogen peroxide, and the hydrogen peroxide reacts with a chromophore in the
presence of peroxidase to produce a colored product that is measured at 546 nm
(secondary wavelength = 700 nm). This is an endpoint reaction that agrees well
with recognized HPLC methods, and it has the advantage over Jaffe picric acid-
based methods that are susceptible to interferences from non-creatinine
chromogens.  
  
Creatinine is produced by creatine and creatine phosphate as a result of
muscle metabolic processes. Creatinine is the waste product derived from
muscle creatinine and is released into the blood at a relatively constant
rate. It is then excreted by glomerular filtration during normal renal
function. The amount of creatinine per unit of muscle mass is constant;
therefore, increased blood creatinine is the best indicator of impaired kidney
function  
Creatinine may be measured in both serum and urine. Creatinine measurement is
useful in the diagnosis and treatment of renal diseases, in monitoring renal
dialysis, and as a calculation basis for other urinary analytes (e.g. total
protein, microalbumin). The ratio of urine albumin to urine creatinine is used
to predict nephropathy risk in diabetic patients. (For the NHANES IV survey,
urine creatinine is used as a reference analyte against which are measured
other urine analytes, such as pesticides and heavy metals, and urine
albumin/creatinine ratio).  
  
There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to the lab site.
There were changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment and lab
method for urinary creatinine. During 2007-2008 urinary creatinine was
measured using Roche/Hitachi Modular P Chemistry Analyzer and using Beckman
Synchron CX3 Clinical Analyzer  
A detailed description of the laboratory method used can be found on the
NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the General Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
Analytic methodology section.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the General
Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

**Urine Creatinine Adjustment to compare 2007-2008 to 2005-2006**

There was a change in the instrumentation and method for urine creatinine from
2006 to 2007. Prior to 2007, the urine creatinine was performed on the Beckman
CX3 using a Jaffe reaction. From 2007 forward, the urine creatinine was
performed on the Roche ModP using an enzymatic (creatinase) method. The
preferred method is the enzymatic method since the Jaffe method is subject to
more interference.

Crossover studies were performed between the ModP and CX3 methods. Initial
crossover analysis revealed that the mean CX3 was 134.7 mg/dL and the mean
ModP was 129.7 mg/dL (an average bias of -3.7%).

A second crossover was designed more optimally in the selection of the
specimens. The specimens were from all age groups, equal number of males and
females, at least 25% Non-Hispanic Blacks, specimens were collected over the
entire period of 2005-2006 with a more uniform distribution of lab values, and
the crossover was analyzed for a 1 month period. The mean of data for the
crossover CX3 was 140.6 mg/dL and the mean ModP was 134.9 mg/dL (an average
bias of -4.1%).

The distribution of urine creatinine was not Gaussian and the square root
transform of the data produced a normal distribution. This improved the
comparison of the adjusted 2005-2006 urine creatinine distribution to the 2007
data. A piecewise square root transformed adjustment of 2005-2006 data further
improved the comparison of 2005-2006 to 2007. The following equations are
recommended to adjust urine creatinine prior to 2007 to compare with urine
creatinine from 2007 forward. The units of urine creatinine are mg/dL:

Urine Creatinine < 75: Y(adjusted Creatinine) = [1.02*sqrt(X, unadjusted
Creatinine) - 0.36]**2

Urine Creatinine 75 to < 250: Y(adjusted Creatinine) = [1.05*sqrt(X,
unadjusted Creatinine) - 0.74]**2

Urine Creatinine >=250: Y(adjusted Creatinine) = [1.01*sqrt(X, unadjusted
Creatinine) - 0.10]**2

A weighted analysis of NHANES 2007-2008 vs. 2005-2006 on urine creatinine was
performed applying the piecewise regressions above. This revealed a lower bias
where the mean of adjusted data for 2005-2006 creatinines was 123.31 mg/dL and
the mean of the 2007-2008 creatinines was 122.36 mg/dL (an average bias of
-0.77%).

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. They also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups. The
phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may
be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the Analytic
Guidelines for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues. The Analytic Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
