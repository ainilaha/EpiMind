# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2017-2018 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Health Insurance (HIQ_J)

####  Data File: HIQ_J.xpt

##### First Published: February 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Health Insurance questionnaire (variable name prefix HIQ) provides
respondent-level interview data on insurance coverage, type of insurance
coverage, coverage of prescription drugs, and uninsured status during the past
12 months.

## Eligible Sample

All participants were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

HIQ was asked in the home, by trained interviewers, using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Persons reporting Medicare
insurance coverage were asked to show their Medicare card.

Persons 16 years of age and older and emancipated minors were interviewed
directly. A proxy provided information for survey participants who were under
16 years of age and for individuals who could not answer the questions
themselves.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed for completeness, consistency, and illogical values.

## Analytic Notes

Although these data were collected as part of the household questionnaire, if
they are merged with exam data, exam sample weights should be used for the
analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
