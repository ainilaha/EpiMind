## Component Description

N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, commonly known as DEET, has become a widely
used insect repellent in the United States. DEET is highly effective against a
broad spectrum of insect pests, including potential disease vectors, such as
mosquitoes, biting flies, and ticks (CDC, 2015). More than 500 products are
currently registered with the Environmental Protection Agency in a variety of
liquids, lotions, gels, sprays, sticks, and impregnated materials with DEET
concentrations ranging from 5 to 98% (EPA, 2017). Every year, approximately
one-third of the U.S. population uses DEET-containing insect repellents (CDC,
2009), and exposure to DEET is widespread (Calafat et al., 2016). Urinary
metabolites of DEET are more sensitive biomarkers of exposure than DEET
itself; in fact, relying on DEET as an exposure biomarker can lead to exposure
misclassification (Calafat et al., 2016; ATSDR, 2017).

To better understand exposure to DEET, a surplus project testing
3-(Ethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid (ug/L) was also performed in a one-third
subsample of participants 3+ years of age from NHANES 2015-2016 (SSDEET_I), in
addition to the one measured DEET metabolite in this dataset
(3-(diethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid).

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible and participants
aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The method uses 0.2 mL of urine for quantifying two DEET metabolites:
3-(diethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid and 3-(ethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid; four
neonicotinoid insecticides: acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and
thiacloprid; and two neonicotinoid metabolites: N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and
5-hydroxy-imidaclopridand. The method is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of
urinary conjugates of the target analytes, online solid phase extraction,
reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography separation, and isotope
dilution-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection (Baker et
al., 2018).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.  
  
There were no changes to the lab equipment or lab site for this component in
the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle. However, the lab method was changed to include
neonicotinoid insecticide biomarkers, and one additional DEET metabolite.
These data can be found in the Neonicotinoids â [Urine (Surplus)
(SSNEON_I)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/SSNEON_I.htm) and DEET
Metabolite â Urine (Surplus) (SSDEET_I) datasets on this website.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.  
  
Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they were
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.  
  
The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciencesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample weights**

DEET and metabolites were measured in a full sample of participants ages 3-5
and a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample
weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights
for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2015-2016/DEMO_I.XPT) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in âLCâ (ex., URDDEALC indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above
the limit of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXDEA) provides the
analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the
lower limit of detection (i.e., URDDEALC=1), an imputed fill value was placed
in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection
divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ng/mL) for DEET metabolite is:

**Variable Name** |  ****Analyte Description**** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URXDEA |  3-(diethylcarbamoyl)benzoic acid (DEET acid) (ng/mL) |  0.20
