# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2003-2004 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Reproductive Health (RHQ_C)

####  Data File: RHQ_C.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2006

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

This section contains questions for women only on reproductive health
including menstrual history, pregnancy history, lactation, oral contraceptive
and hormone replacement therapy use, and other related conditions.

## Eligible Sample

Female mobile exam center (MEC) participants ages 12 years and older.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The questions were asked in computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) in the
MEC.

The Interviewer Procedure Manuals and Exam Manuals as well as the survey
questionnaire can be found on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

The reproductive health questionnaire is a complex, detailed set of questions
that includes the administration of questions according to age group or skip
patterns based on responses to various reproductive health conditions. While
data were reviewed and edited for completeness and illogical values,
inconsistencies in the responses to these self-reported questions remain. Some
of these inconsistencies are noted below. Data analysts are strongly
encouraged to carefully review all variables of interest prior to data
analysis.

## Analytic Notes

Since the questions were asked in MEC, the MEC sample weights should be used
in data analysis.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines, located on the NHANES website, for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

Notes about specific variables and changes from previous data releases
include:

**RHQ031:** At least one menstrual period in past 12 months. Previous data
releases had regular periods in the past 12 months (RHQ030).

**RHQ051:** When did respondent have last period. Previously called RHQ050.

**RHD080:** Days since last period. Women who reported having had a menstrual
period in the past 2 months were asked to report the date of their last
menstrual period. The derived variable was created by subtracting the number
of days between the reported month and day the period began and the date of
the MEC interview. Please note that for this variable extreme values were
retained and should be carefully examined prior to analysis. There are several
instances of women who reported that they were currently menstruating (RHQ051)
who provided a date which may indicate that they were reporting on their last
menstrual period.

**RHQ131:** Ever been pregnant? Previously called RHQ130.

**RHD143:** Are you pregnant now? This question is similar to RHQ140 in the
1999-2000 data release and

**RHQ141** in the 2001-2002 release which asked "Do you think that you are
pregnant now?" The age range was broadened from 15-49 in 1999-2000 to 12-59
for the following years. See also Laboratory file variable URXPREG, urine
pregnancy test result, and combined pregnancy variable on the demographic file
(DEMO_C).

**RHD152:** What month of pregnancy are you in? Called RHQ150 in the 1999-2000
data release and **RHQ151** in the 2001-2002 release. The age range for this
questioned was broadened from 15-49 in 1999-2000 to 12-59.

**RHD170:** Number of pregnancies resulting in live births. If the total
number of pregnancies resulting in live births was greater than 11, the number
was top coded to 11 for the purpose of confidentiality. There are a few
instances where the number of pregnancies resulting in a live birth is greater
than the number of pregnancies. This may have occurred as a result of women
reporting number of lives births rather than "pregnancies" resulting in live
births.

**RHQ180:** Age at first live birth. If a woman reported that she had only one
live birth (RHD170=1), the age at the time of that live birth is reported in
RHQ190 (age at last live birth).

**RHQ291:** Age when had hysterectomy. Called RHQ290 in previous data
releases. Please note that there are instances in which women reported an age
of hysterectomy that is earlier than the age of last menstrual period
(RHQ060).
