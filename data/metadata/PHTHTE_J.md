### Phthalates and Plasticizers Metabolites - Urine (PHTHTE_J)

####  Data File: PHTHTE_J.xpt

##### First Published: August 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and
harder to break. They are often called plasticizers. Some phthalates are used
as solvents (dissolving agents) for other materials. They are used in many
products, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, detergents, lubricating oils,
automotive plastics, plastic clothes (raincoats), and personal-care products
(soaps, shampoos, hair sprays, and nail polishes). Phthalates are used widely
in polyvinyl chloride plastics, which are used to make products such as
plastic packaging film and sheets, garden hoses, inflatable toys, blood-
storage containers, and medical tubing. 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid,
diisononyl ester (DINCH) is used as a replacement of some high molecular
weight phthalates. Once phthalates or DINCH enter a person's body, they are
converted into breakdown products (metabolites) that pass out quickly in
urine.

Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a commonly used plasticizer. The use of
DEHP in the U.S. market appears to be decreasing, at least in part because of
legislative efforts, while the use of di-isononyl phthalate (DiNP), one of the
replacements of DEHP, and other phthalate alternatives, may be rising (Calafat
et al. 2011; Zota et al. 2014). Di-2-ethylhexyl terephthalate (DEHTP), a
structural isomer of DEHP and one of such alternatives, has been used as a
plasticizer for polymers contained in consumer products (Beeler 1976). To
better understand exposure to phthalates alternatives,
mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl terephthalate (MEHHTP),
mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl terephthalate (MECPTP), two metabolites of DEHTP,
and monooxoisononyl phthalate (MONP), an additional metabolite of DiNP were
quantified.

Biomeasures of phthalates and phthalates alternatives in humans are necessary
to evaluate potential human health effects from exposure to these chemicals.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The test principle utilizes high performance liquid chromatography-
electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for the
quantitative detection in urine of the following metabolites: monoethyl
phthalate (MEP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP),
mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP),
monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), monoisononyl phthalate (MNP),
mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)
phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP),
monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP), monocarboxynonyl phthalate (MCNP), and
cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono (hydroxy-isononyl) ester (MHNCH) (Silva
et al., 2007). Urinary MEHHTP, MECPTP and MONP were measured by an online
solid phase extraction coupled with isotope dilution-high performance liquid
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry approach previously described (Silva
et al. 2013). Urine samples are processed using enzymatic deconjugation of the
glucuronidated metabolites followed by online solid phase extraction (SPE)
coupled with reversed phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Assay precision is improved by
incorporating isotopically labeled internal standards of the phthalate
metabolites and MHNCH. In addition, 4-methyl umbelliferyl glucuronide is used
to monitor deconjugation efficiency. This selective method allows for rapid
detection of metabolites of commonly used phthalates and DINCH in human urine
with limits of detection in the low ng/mL range.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Phthalates and Plasticizers Metabolites Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/PHTHTE-J-
MET-508.pdf) (August 2021)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they were
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary metals were measured in a full sample of participants ages 3-5 and a
one third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights
are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

The analytes included in this dataset were measured for all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. For participants aged 3-5, their WTSB2YR are equivalent to
their MEC exam sample weights. These participants have completed at least one
physical exam component in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample
weight larger than "0," regardless of their lab test results. For participants
6 years and older, special sample weights were created for the subsample.
These special weights accounted for the additional probability of selection
into the subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if participants 6 years and older were selected as part of the one-
third subsample, but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the
sample weight value assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-2018 Demographic
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
"Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDCNPLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDCNPLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXCNP) provides the
analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for the phthalates and
plasticizers metabolites:
