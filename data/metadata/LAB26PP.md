### Pesticides - Current Use - Urine (Formerly Priority Pesticides, Non-
persistent Pesticide Metabolites) (LAB26PP)

####  Data File: LAB26PP.xpt

##### First Published: June 2002

##### Last Revised: January 2012

## Component Description

**Priority Pesticides (Non-Persistent Pesticide Metabolites) and Urinary
Organophosphate Pesticides**

Pesticide residues and their metabolites in human tissues and fluids can be
indicative of pesticide exposure and the total body burden of these
pesticides. Little information is available concerning residential or
household exposures to pesticides among the general population. Sufficient
data do exist, however, from surveys or other focused research efforts to
suggest that household exposure to certain common pesticides can be extensive
and might be of significant public health concern. Pesticides of particular
concern are: chlorpyrifos, 2,4-D, diazinon, permethrin, ortho-phenyl phenol,
methyl parathion, and organophosphate pesticides.

## Eligible Sample

Subsample of participants aged 6 years to 59 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing.  
  
**Priority Pesticides**

Priority pesticides (non-persistent pesticide metabolites) were measured using
two mass spectrometric methods.

**Hydrolysis, extraction, derivatization, chromatography, mass spectrometry**

This method measures human metabolites of the pesticides chlorpyrifos,
chlorpyrifosmethyl, naphthalene, and carbaryl in urine. The procedure involves
enzymatic hydrolysis of urine, extraction, derivatization, and column cleanup,
followed by analysis of the concentrate using capillary gas chromatography
combined with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). This procedure uses isotope
dilution with 13C-labeled internal standards for all analytes. During
analysis, the analytes dissociate into charged fragments (ions) that are
specific to each analyte. Two ions from each analyte and two ions from each
13C-labeled internal standard are monitored and the abundances of each ion are
measured. The ratios of these ions are used as criterion for evaluating the
data. By evaluating these analytes in urine, a measurement of the body burden
of each pesticide is obtained. For example, the amount of 1-naphthol observed
in a person's urine indicates exposure to naphthalene, a common household
pesticide used in moth repellents.

**Organic Liquid Extraction, Liquid Chromatography, Tandem Mass Spectrometry**

This method is used for determining concentrations of select pesticide
metabolites in the human population. Urine samples are prepared by extracting
with an organic solvent and concentration of the solute. The concentrate is
analyzed using liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometric
(LC/MS/MS) determination.

The metabolites (MS parent compound) are: atrazine mercapturate (ATZ),
malathion dicarboxylic acid (MDA), 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine
(IMPY), 3- phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid
(2,4-D).

**Urinary Organophosphate Pesticides**

Urinary organophosphate pesticides uses azeotropic codistillation of urine,
derivitization, gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method (GC-
MS/MS). This method can be used to quantify the six dialkylphosphate human
metabolites of organophosphate pesticides in urine. The procedure involves an
azeotropic distillation of urine, derivatization using chloroiodopropane, and
analysis of the chloropropyl phosphate esters using GC-MS/MS. This procedure
uses isotope dilution with deuterium or 13C-labeled internal standards for all
analytes. During analysis, the protonated analytes dissociate into charged
fragments (ions) that are specific to each analyte. Two ions from each analyte
and two ions from each labeled internal standard are monitored, and the
abundances of each ion are measured. The ratios of these ions are used as
criteria for evaluating the data. By evaluating these analytes in urine, a
combined measurement of the body burden of common organophosphate pesticides
(cumulative exposure) is obtained.

## Data Processing and Editing

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing.

## Analytic Notes

The list of chemicals in the following table have been withdrawn from the
1999-2000 and 2001-2002 Urinary Priority Pesticides and Organophosphate
Pesticides files (Lab26PP, l26PP_B) due to unacceptable levels of calibration
bias. The results for chemicals originally included in the [National Report on
Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals](http://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/)
have been removed from the website version of the report.

Measures of priority pesticides (non-persistent pesticide metabolites), and
urinary organophosphate pesticides are assessed in a one-half subsample of
participants ages 6-11 years and a one-third subsample of participants aged 12
years and older. Use the special weights included in this data file when
analyzing data. Read the "Special Sample Weights for this Dataset"
instructions provided below before beginning analysis.

**Detection Limits**

For the six nonspecific organophosphate metabolites, URXOP1-URXOP6, the
detection limit was constant. In cases, where the result was below the limit
of detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided by
the square root of two.

In most cases, the detection limit was variable for the other pesticide
metabolites in the data set. Two variables are provided for each of these
analytes. The variable named URD_LC indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection. There are two values: "0" and "1"; "1" indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. The other variable named URX_
provides the analytic result for that analyte. In cases, where the result was
below the limit of detection, the value for that variable is the detection
limit divided by the square root of two.

**Special Sample Weights for this Dataset**

Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.  
Measures of this urinary multi-analyte profile are assessed in participants
aged 6 years and over on a randomly selected subsample. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data.

The dataset includes 2-year and 4-year subsample weights. The 4-year weights
should be used if these 2001-2002 data are combined with 1999-2000 data. The
1999-2000 data files have been updated to include the subsample 4-year
weights. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively), which are
included in the demographic data file for each data release. For further
information, see the NHANES Analytic Guidelines.

**Special Notes for this Dataset**

The analysis of NHANES 1999-2000 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 1999-2000
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Household Questionnaire and other data files may be linked to
the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.
