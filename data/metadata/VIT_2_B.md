# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2001-2002 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Vitamin A, Vitamin E, & Carotenoids, Second Exam (VIT_2_B)

####  Data File: VIT_2_B.xpt

#####  First Published: August 2010

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Second Day Exams**

**See the general documentation on Second Day laboratory exams.** See the
general documentation on second day laboratory exams. Also, see the
documentation for the primary exam data for Laboratory 6 (Vitamins A, E and
Carotenoids).  
  
**Vitamin A (retinol, retinyl palmitate, retinyl stearate), Vitamin E
(a-tocopherol andÂ y-tocopherol), Carotenoids (a-carotene, trans-Ã-carotene,
cis Ã-carotene,Â Ã-cryptoxanthin, combined lutein/zeaxanthin, and trans-
lycopene)****  
**  
The objectives of this component are: 1) to provide data for monitoring
secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2) to
evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity
and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's
nutritional status; and 3) to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and
public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food
fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status
of the U.S. population. These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and
toxicities of specific nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide
population reference data, and to estimate the contribution of diet,
supplements, and other factors to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used
for research to further define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels
for disease prevention and health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 16-69 years who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria
are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum concentrations of vitamins A (retinol) and E (α and γ-tocopherol), two
retinyl esters, and six carotenoids are measured using high performance liquid
chromatography with photodiode array detection. A small volume (100 uL) of
serum is mixed with an ethanol solution containing two internal standards-
retinyl butyrate and nonapreno-β-carotene (C45). The micronutrients are
extracted from the aqueous phase into hexane and dried under vacuum. The
extract is redissolved in ethanol and acetonitrile and is filtered to remove
any insoluble material. An aliquot of the filtrate is injected onto a C18
reversed phase column and isocratically eluted with a mobile phase consisting
of equal parts of ethanol and acetonitrile. Absorbance of these substances in
solution is linearly proportional to concentration, thus spectrophotometric
methods are used for quantitative analysis. Three wavelengths, approximately
corresponding to absorption maxima, namely, 300, 325, and 450 nm, are
simultaneously monitored and chromatograms are recorded. Quantitation is
accomplished by comparing the peak height of the analyte in the unknown with
the peak height of a known amount of the same analyte in a calibrator
solution. Calculations are corrected based on the peak height of the internal
standard in the unknown compared with the peak height of the internal standard
in the calibrator solution. Retinol and the retinyl esters are compared with
retinyl butyrate at 325 nm, α and γ-tocopherol are compared with retinyl
butyrate at 300 nm, and the carotenoids are compared with C45 at 450 nm.

## Data Processing and Editing

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES LPM. Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions
until they were shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for
testing.

This file contains no top coding.

Eleven derived variables were created in this data file. The formula for their
derivatization is as follows:  
  
The vitamin A (retinol) results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.03491.  
  
The retinyl palmitate results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.03491.  
  
The retinyl stearate results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.03491.  
  
The vitamin E (α-tocopherol) results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.02322.  
  
The γ-tocopherol results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying by
0.02402.  
  
The α-carotene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying by
0.01863.  
  
The trans-β-carotene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.01863.  
  
The cis-β-carotene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying
by 0.01863.  
  
The β-cryptoxanthin results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying
by 0.01810.  
  
The combined lutein/zeaxanthin results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.01758.  
  
The trans-lycopene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying
by 0.01863.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

There weren't any changes to the laboratory, method, or site from 2001-2002.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

**The second day exam data was a convenience sample and thus did not have
sample weights.** The analysis of NHANES 2001â2002 laboratory data must be
conducted with the key survey design and basic demographic variables. The
NHANES 2001â2002 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic
data, health indicators, and other related information collected during
household interviews. The Household Questionnaire Data Files also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.Â
