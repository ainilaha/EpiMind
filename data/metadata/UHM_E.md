### Metals - Urine (UHM_E)

####  Data File: UHM_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2009

#####  Last Revised: September 2011

## Component Description

Trace metals have been associated with adverse health effects in occupational
studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in general
population groups.

This method is used to achieve rapid and accurate quantifications of multiple
elements of toxicological and nutritional interest. The method is sensitive
and rapid enough to screen urine specimens from subjects suspected to be
exposed to a number of important toxic elements, or to evaluate environmental
or other nonoccupationally exposure to these same elements.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older, who met the subsample requirements, were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. Detailed
specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the General
Documentation on Laboratory Data file for detailed data processing and editing
protocols.

Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a multi-element
analytical technique (Date AR, et al., 1989). Liquid samples are introduced
into the ICP through a nebulizer and spray chamber carried by a flowing argon
stream. By coupling radio-frequency power into flowing argon, plasma is
created in which the predominant species are positive argon ions and
electrons. The sample passes through a region of the plasma that has a
temperature of 6000â8000 K. The thermal energy atomizes the sample and then
ionizes the atoms. The ions, along with the argon, enter the mass spectrometer
through an interface that separates the ICP from the mass spectrometer, which
is operating at an atmospheric pressure of 10â5 torr. The mass spectrometer
permits ions at each mass to be detected in rapid sequence, allowing
individual isotopes of an element to be determined. Electrical signals
resulting from the detection of the ions are processed into digital
information that is used to indicate first the intensity of the ions and then
the concentration of the element. The ICP-MS method is used to measure the
following 12 elements in urine: beryllium (Be), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo),
cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), cesium (Cs), barium (Ba), tungsten (W), platinum
(Pt), thallium (TI), lead (Pb), and uranium (U). This method is based on the
method by (MulliganÂ KJ, et al. 1990) Â Urine samples are diluted 1+9 with 2%
(v/v), double-distilled, concentrated nitric acid containing both iridium (Ir)
and rhodium (Rh) for multi-internal standardization. This procedure can be
used for all 12 elements or for subsets of the 12 elements.

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.

A detailed description of the laboratory methods used can be found on the
NHANES website.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation, during
unscheduled visits, to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and
the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind, split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition,
contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all
specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Scienceâs quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard 1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Urinary heavy metals were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6 years
and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2007-2008 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The lower detection limits for all analytes were constant during this two-year
cycle. The detection limit divided by the square root of 2 is the value that
is provided for results that are below the limit of detection.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website.
