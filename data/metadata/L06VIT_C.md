### Vitamin C (L06VIT_C)

####  Data File: L06VIT_C.xpt

#####  First Published: April 2006

#####  Last Revised: October 2009

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are: 1) to provide data for monitoring
secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2) to
evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity
and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's
nutritional status; and 3) to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and
public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food
fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status
of the U.S. population. These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and
toxicities of specific nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide
population reference data, and to estimate the contribution of diet,
supplements, and other factors to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used
for research to further define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels
for disease prevention and health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria are eligible.Â

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in serum is measured by isocratic HPLC with
electrochemical detection at 650 mV. One part serum is mixed with four parts
of 6% MPA to acidify the serum and stabilize the ascorbate. The specimen is
frozen at â70Â°C until analysis. After the specimen is thawed at room
temperature and centrifuged at 2500 rpm, the supernatant is decanted. This
supernatant is mixed with a solution containing trisodium phosphate and
dithiothreitol (to reduce dehydroascorbate to ascorbate) and then re-acidified
with 40% MPA to stabilize the ascorbate. The sample is filtered to remove
insoluble material. An aliquot is injected onto a C-18 reversed-phase column
and eluted with a mobile phase containing 0.15 mol/L monochloroacetic acid, 2
mmol/L disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate, and 0.13 mmol/L octylsulfonic
acid, adjusted to pH 3.00 Â± 0.05 with 10 N sodium hydroxide. Quantitation is
by peak height and is based on a standard curve generated by using three
different concentrations of an external standard (0.005, 0.030, and 0.100
mg/dL).A detailed description of the laboratory method used can be found on
the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES LPM. Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â20Â°C) conditions
until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for
testing.

This file contains no top coding; however, 11 results were set to missing
because of possible contamination.

One derived variable was created in this data file. The formula for its
derivation is as follows:  
The vitamin C in mg/dL was converted to Âµmol/L by multiplying by
56.78.Testing for vitamin C began in 2003.Â Detailed instructions on specimen
collection and processing can be found on the NHANES website.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

**Comparing Vitamin C in NHANES 2003-2004 to NHANES III (1988-1994)**

**

An isocratic reverse-phase HPLC method with electrochemical detection of
vitamin C (ascorbic acid) was used for NHANES 2003â2004 (McCoy et al, 2005)
and a similar method was used for NHANES III during 1988-1994 (Gunter et al,
1996). The methods differed in several ways. For 2003â2004, but not for
NHANES III, calibrators were treated as samples in the assay, i.e., subjected
to the same sample preparation steps. Also, an internal standard was used in
all sample preparations to correct results for recovery for NHANES 2003â2004
but not for NHANES III. Quality assurance data were compared to assess
differences in serum vitamin C assay precision with the use of the two assay
methods. NHANES III bench quality control (QC) data for 3 pools, ranging in
concentration from 21.0 to 88.6 umol/L, had coefficients of variation (CV)
between 5% and 8%. During NHANES 2003â2004, 3 bench QC pools, ranging from
13.6 to 122.7 umol/L, had CVs from 5% to 9%. Blind QC pools used in NHANES III
ranged in concentration from 5.1 to 48.9 umol/L and had CVs from 51% to 74%.
In NHANES 2003â2004, the blind QC pool concentrations ranged from 13.1 to
92.1 umol/L and had CVs of 5â9%. Split sample data (n=151) collected during
NHANES III showed an average CV of 35%. Split sample data was not collected
during NHANES 2003-2004. A comparison of the accuracy of methods was made with
the use of NIST standard reference materials SRM 970 (Margolis et al, 1996).
With the use of the NHANES III assay method, values were 92â93% of target
values compared with 100â102% of target values with the NHANES 2003â2004
method (McCoy et al, 2005). With the use of 308 convenience specimens, the
average bias between assay methods was 2.6% with the NHANES 2003â2004
method, giving higher values than the NHANES III method, however, the bias was
concentration dependent with less bias at lower concentrations. For comparison
with NHANES 2003â 2004, NHANES III data can be adjusted with the use of a
Deming regression equation, where the adjusted values:  
NHANES 2003-2004 Vitamin C = 1.0566 (NHANES III Vitamin C) -1.9345 using
Vitamin C units of umol/L (McCoy et al, 2005).Â SeeÂ (Schleicher et al, 2009)
for further details.

**General Note on the Use of NHANES 2003-2004 Data:**

The analysis of NHANES 2003â2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003â2004
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Household Questionnaire Data Files also contain all survey
design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.
