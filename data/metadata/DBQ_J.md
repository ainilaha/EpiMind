### Diet Behavior & Nutrition (DBQ_J)

####  Data File: DBQ_J.xpt

##### First Published: February 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Diet Behavior and Nutrition questionnaire (variable name prefix DBQ)
provides personal interview data on various dietary behavior and nutrition
related topics. Many of the questions were included in NHANES II (1976-80),
Hispanic HANES (1982-84), NHANES III (1988-94), and NHANES 1999-2016. Topics
included in the DBQ are:

  * Breastfeeding and other childhood feeding practices (≤ 6 yrs); 
  * Current milk consumption pattern and types of milk (≥ 1 yr); 
  * Milk consumption pattern throughout life span (≥ 20 yrs); 
  * Community or government meal program participation for seniors  (≥ 60 yrs); 
  * School meal program participation (4-19 yrs); 
  * Self-appraised healthfulness level of one's own diet (≥ 16 yrs); 
  * Frequency of getting meals prepared away from home (≥ 1 yr); 
  * Frequency of meals gotten from fast-food or pizza places (≥ 1 yr); 
  * Use of convenience foods (≥ 1 yr); 
  * Awareness of My Plate program (≥ 16 yrs); and
  * Meal planner/shopper/preparer status (≥ 16 yrs). 

Information on individual participant's food choices, such as getting meals
prepared away from home, meals from fast-food or pizza places, use of
convenience foods or ready-to-eat meals bought in stores, and the
participant's awareness of the My Plate program as well as his/her meal
planner/shopper/preparer status at home in the DBQ section were collected as
part of the core set of the Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module.
The FCBS module has been included in NHANES since 2007, and was developed in
collaboration with the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA). It is designed to collect information on people's
knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward nutrition and food choices. The FCBS
module has two elements: a core set of questions asked during the NHANES
household interview, and a supplementary module asked as a telephone follow-up
interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data collection
cycle.

In addition to questions included in the DBQ section, the 2017-2018 core set
of questions for the FCBS module also included questions at participant's
family level. For example, family monthly income and family assets, food
expenditures, as well as family's participation on federal food assistance
programs. The family food expenditures data are released in the Consumer
Behavior (CBQ) section, while the monthly income and family assets data are
included in the Income (INQ), and food program participation data are included
in the Food Security (FSQ) sections.

Data from the phone follow-up FCBS supplementary module are to be released in
separate files and made available on the NHANES website as well. Similar to
other datasets in the NHANES 2017-2018 release cycle, all FCBS related data
files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). For more
information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the documentation
accompanying the datasets.

## Eligible Sample

The target age groups for questions in this section vary by the topic. For
example, the questions pertaining to infant nutrition and breastfeeding were
asked of proxy respondents for children 6 years of age and younger; and senior
meal program participation questions were asked of respondents 60 years of age
and older. Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency
counts were verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

Questions on the frequencies of getting meals prepared away from home
(DBD895), meals from fast-food or pizza places (DBD900), and use of
convenience foods (DBD905 and DBD910) were answered by participants 12-15
years old, at the mobile examination center (MEC), using the Audio Computer
Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) system. The same questions were asked of
participants 1-11 years and of participants 16 years and older, in the home,
by trained interviewers using the Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI)
system. All other questions in this section were asked in the home, as well.

Hand cards showing response categories were also used for some questions. When
necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to respondents. Persons 16
years of age and older and emancipated minors were interviewed directly. A
proxy provided information for survey participants who were under 16 years of
age and for individuals who could not answer the questions themselves.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All data was reviewed by the
NHANES field office staff for accuracy and completeness.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some
variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of
the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure
concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing
process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e.,
DBQ) to a D (i.e., DBD). For example, some data were collected using two
variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable) but combined into
a single variable for data release purposes.

**DBD020, DBD030, DBD041, DBD050, DBD055, and DBD061** (Breastfeeding and
other childhood feeding practices)  
This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to
allow respondents to report the age of interest in days, weeks, months, or
years. The released variables were edited to standardize the reported age to
number of days, using the following conversion factors: 7 days/week, 30.4
days/month and 365 days/year. If the age for the time stopped breastfeeding
(DBD030), or stopped receiving formula (DBD050), or first fed milk (DBD060)
was reported as older than 1095 days (3 years), the value was re-coded as
"666666." Similarly, if the age for the time first fed formula (DBD041) was
reported as older than 365 days (1 year), or the age for the time started
other food/beverage than breastmilk/formula was reported as older than 730
days (2 years), the value was re-coded as "666666" as well.

**DBD895** (Frequency of getting meals prepared away from home)  
Respondents were asked how many times they had gotten meals that were prepared
away from home in the past 7 days. If the frequency was reported as "never,"
the value was re-coded as "0." If the frequency was reported more than 21
times per week, the value was re-coded as "5555."

**DBD900** (Frequency of getting meals from fast food or pizza places)  
Respondents were asked how many times they had gotten meals from fast food or
pizza places in the past 7 days. If the frequency was reported as "never," the
value was re-coded as "0." If the frequency was reported more than 21 times
per week, the value was re-coded as "5555."

**DBD905 and DBD910** (Use of convenience foods)  
This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to
allow respondents to report the frequency of interest as either per day, per
week, or per month. The released variables were edited to standardize the
reported frequency to number of times in the last 30 days. If the frequency
was reported as "never," the value was re-coded as "0." If the frequency was
reported more than 90 times in the last 30 days, the value was re-coded as
"6666."

## Analytic Notes

**DBD895, DBD900, DBD905, and DBD910**(Frequency of getting meals prepared
away from home, frequency of meals got from fast-food or pizza places, and use
of convenience foods)  
These questions were asked as part of household interview for participants
1-11 (proxy interview used) and 16 or more years of age, the interview sample
weights may be used in their analysis. However, if the data is joined with
other data from the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), the exam sample weights
should be used. Analysis of these questions for 12 to 15 year olds should use
the exam sample weights because the questions were asked in the MEC for this
age group.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. Both are
available on the NHANES website.
