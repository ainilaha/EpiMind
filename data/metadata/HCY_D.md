### Homocysteine (HCY_D)

####  Data File: HCY_D.xpt

#####  First Published: March 2009

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are:

  1. to provide data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 
  2. to evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status; and 
  3. to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. 

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.



## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 20 year and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma is measured by the "Abbott Homocysteine
(HCY) assay", a fully automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA)
from Abbott Diagnostics (1,2). In brief, dithiothreitol (DTT) reduces
homocysteine bound to albumin and to other small molecules, homocysteine, and
mixed disulfides, to free thiol. S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase
catalyzes conversion of homocysteine to SAH in the presence of added
adenosine. In the subsequent steps, the specific monoclonal antibody and the
fluoresceinated SAH analog tracer constitute the FPIA detection system (2).
Plasma total homocysteine concentrations were calculated by the Abbott Axsym®
using a machine-stored calibration curve (3,4).

An international round robin performed in 1998 (5) demonstrated that this
method is fully equivalent to other most frequently used methods in this field
(i.e., HPLC-FD, HPLC-ED, GC/MS). Thus, the Abbott Homocysteine (HCY) assay
will be used as primary method for the determination of plasma total
homocysteine in NHANES 2005-2006. The HPLC assay will be used as a reference
method and will be performed on a subset of NHANES 1999+ for continuing method
comparison and on smaller studies.

## Data Processing and Editing

Plasma specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

This file contains no top coding.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

**Adjustment of Homocysteine Values:**

During 2006, the manufacturer of the Homocysteine reagents (Abbott)
distributed, without prior notice, a reformulated reagent kit that increased
the Homocysteine values (on average about 13%). Crossover studies were
performed on NHANES specimens to compare pre- and post-reformulation of the
kits to develop regression equations to adjust post-kit reformulation values.
The regression equations adjusted the post-kit reformulation values
appropriately and were checked on sample person distributions before and after
kit reformulation.

**General Comments:**

The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables.

The NHANES 2005-2006 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic
data, health indicators, and other related information collected during
household interviews. The Household Questionnaire Data Files also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.
