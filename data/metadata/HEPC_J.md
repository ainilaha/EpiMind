## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the
United States. Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and
control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of
asymptomatic infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of
these diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a
nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide
the most reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will
be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.

In 2013, CDC revised its guidelines for Hepatitis C (HCV) testing because of
1) changes in the availability of certain commercial HCV antibody tests; 2)
evidence that many persons who are identified as reactive by an HCV antibody
test might not subsequently be evaluated to determine if they have current HCV
infection; and 3) there have been significant advances in the development of
antiviral agents with improved efficacy against HCV.1

The flow chart for the new Hepatitis C algorithm can be found in the
laboratory method file or by following the MMWR link below.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA)**

The COBAS AMPLICOR HCV MONITOR Test, version 2 0 (v2.0) is an in vitro nucleic
acid amplification test for the quantitation of Hepatitis C Virus RNA in human
serum or plasma on the COBAS AMPLICOR Analyzer.

**Hepatitis C Confirmed Antibody (INNO-LIA)**

In 2012 and earlier years, the hepatitis C virus testing algorithm began with
an antibody screening test, and antibody screening reactive samples were then
tested with a recombinant/synthetic immunoblot assay as the antibody
confirmation test. Samples with positive antibody confirmation results were
then tested with a nucleic acid amplification test for hepatitis C virus RNA.
HCV-RNA positive samples were then tested with a line probe assay to determine
the virus genotype from six genotypes, and subtype for genotype 1, the most
prevalent genotype in the U.S.

Beginning in 2013, samples reactive to the antibody screening test were first
tested for RNA. Then, all RNA positive samples were tested for genotype, and
only RNA negative samples were tested with an antibody confirmation test. This
change in the testing algorithm was made to align the NHANES HCV testing
algorithm with a 2013 update to CDC's guidance on testing for HCV infection by
clinicians and laboratorians. Additionally, the antibody confirmation test
changed to a 3rd generation line immunoassay in 2013 because the test used in
2012 and earlier was no longer commercially available and the stored supply of
these test kits had been exhausted.

For the antibody confirmation test, the manual 16-hour sample incubation test
procedure is used. 10ul of specimens and controls are diluted in 1mL diluent
in test troughs to ensure test strips will slide easily and remain submerged
during incubation. Specimens and controls are incubated with agitation by
rocker at 34 rpm overnight (16±2 hours) at room temperature (18-25°). After a
3X/5min each wash step on microtiter plate shaker, conjugate is added with a
30-minute incubation at room temperature, followed by aspiration, 3X/5min each
wash step and 30-minute incubation in substrate solution also on microtiter
plate shaker. Finally, strips are agitated with stop solution for 10-30
minutes at room temperature. The microtiter plate shaker is set for 160 rpm
and used for all the washes and solution incubations. Strips are then dried
completely in a dry incubator at 37°C for 30 minutes then mounted on the line
immunoassay score data reporting sheet with inverted tape for reading within
one hour using the reading card. The strips have lines for a background
control, three reference lines for antibody (level ±, human IgG, weak
positive; level 1+ human IgG, moderate positive; and level 3+, anti-human Ig,
strong positive), and six lines for HCV antigens (C1, C2, E2, NS3, NS4, and
NS5). Samples with a positive antibody confirmation test result are reported
as positive. Samples with a negative antibody confirmation test result are
reported as negative. Samples with an indeterminate antibody confirmation test
result are released as missing. Only specimens insufficient in quantity are
deemed indeterminate.

**Hepatitis C genotype**

The VERSANT ® HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay (LiPA) is a line probe assay designed to
identify Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 to 6 in human serum or EDTA
plasma samples. Subtype information is available in the majority of cases.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral
Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2[017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen.  Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

This data is qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses.
