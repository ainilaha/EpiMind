### Occupation (OCQ_F)

####  Data File: OCQ_F.xpt

##### First Published: December 2011

##### Last Revised: August 2014

## Component Description

The Occupation Questionnaire Section (prefix OCQ; questions OCD150 to OCQ580)
contains survey participant interview data on employment and variables
relating to the work environment.

OCQ Section Topics:

Data for Survey Participant's Current Job (OCD231-OCD270): weekly hours
worked, public vs. private sector, industry and occupation group, duration of
employment, and workshift data (usual work schedule).

Exposure to Workplace Tobacco Smoke at the Current Job (OCQ290G/OCQ290Q)

Data for the Survey Participant's Longest Job (OCD390G-OCD 395): industry and
occupation group, duration of employment.

Data for the Survey Participant's Lifetime History of Exposure to Mineral and
Organic Dusts, Gases, Fumes, and Vapors in the Workplace (OCQ510-OCQ580;
administered to those ages 16-79 years).

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants aged 16 years and older were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Persons 16 years of age
are interviewed directly.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. During the 2009-2010 data
collection cycle, periodic QC checks were performed on the Occupation
questionnaire data being collected and interviewer specific feedback and
retraining was performed as appropriate.

## Data Processing and Editing

A subject's questionnaire interview responses were entered into a pentop
computer and then uploaded into a computerized database in the same manner as
other sections of the Sample Person Questionnaire. The data was then edited
for completeness, consistency, and illogical values.

## Analytic Notes

In general, analysts are advised to carefully review the question wording in
the OCQ codebook also to make sure they understand question skip patterns and
the definitions employed for Occupation-related variables. Some OCQ questions
need to be considered as an integral part of data collection for other
questionnaire sections, exam or laboratory Components.

Please note that military occupations are not permissible entries for NHANES
current job data because for NHANES, only the civilian, non-institutionalized
population is eligible to participate in the survey. However, civilian
employees of the armed forces are included in the NHANES survey sample and
military occupations are valid entries for the survey participant's longest
job data.

Current Job Information:

The primary focus of the OCQ Questionnaire is data collection for the
participant's work within the previous week, i.e. the participant's Current
Job. The participant's Current Job is defined as the main paid job worked
within the last week, including work on a family farm. When an individual
currently worked multiple jobs, the participant was asked to designate one
main job for the interview. Data collected included:

• The number of hours worked last week--all jobs;  
• Whether the participant usually works 35 or more hours/week;  
• Industry and Occupation group code data;  
• Sector of employment (private, public);  
• Number of months worked on the current, main job;  
• The main reason the participant did not work last week (if not currently
working);  
• A history of workplace tobacco smoke exposure; and  
• The participant's usual work schedule/workshift.

In NHANES, data for exposure to workplace tobacco smoke is collected only for
the participant's Current Job. Exposure to tobacco smoke is defined as when
the participant can smell tobacco smoke at work. The gate question OCQ290G
captures whether or not an interviewee had workplace tobacco smoke exposure.
If there was a history of workplace tobacco smoke exposure, then OCQ290Q
captures the self-reported number of hours/day of that workplace tobacco
exposure took place. A value of "0" in OCQ290Q signifies that workplace
exposure to tobacco smoke occurred, but was less than one hour per day.
Related data to these OCQ questions are the smoking (SMQ) questionnaire and
laboratory data for serum cotinine.

Longest Job Information:

In NHANES 2009-10, both industry and occupation data and duration of
employment were collected for the subject's Longest Job. Also in NHANES
2009-10, additional questions were asked regarding a lifetime history of
exposure to mineral and organic dusts, gases, fumes, and vapors
(OCQ510-OCQ580). These questions were added to the survey as a part of an
expanded respiratory health data collection for those survey years.  
  
Industry & Occupation Coding:

Four-digit codes were applied to the NHANES 2009-2010 occupation and industry
data using the 2002 U.S. Bureau of the Census Industrial & Occupational
Classification coding system. The coding was done by the Division of
Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies (DSHEFS), which is part of
CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The 2002
Census Bureau industry codes are based on the year 2002 North American
Industry Classification System, and the 2002 Census Bureau occupation codes
are based on the year 2000 Standard Occupational Classification System. In the
OCQ_F public release data file, group code variables are provided that
classify an NHANES survey participant to one of 22 industry groups and to one
of 23 occupation groups. Access to the more detailed four-digit occupation and
industry variables is available through the NHANES Research Data Center (RDC).

Over the past five cycles, the coding system used to code NHANES data have
changed. Researchers need to review these coding systems to ensure that they
are coding and interpreting their findings correctly.

  * The U.S. Census Bureau's 2002 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was used for detailed coding of the 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012 occupation and industry group data.
  * The U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was used for detailed coding of the 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006 occupation and industry group data.

The 2000 and 2002 versions of the Census Bureau Industry and Occupation codes
are comparable in many, but not in all respects, and data analysts who wish to
combine NHANES cycles together should consult NIOSH's documentation on the
comparability of these 2 versions of the Census Bureau's coding system and
available crosswalks before performing their analyses.

Coding manuals, detailed data dictionaries of the alphabetical and classified
indices of industries and occupations, and information about crosswalks
between the coding systems are available (NIOSH, 2017).

Appendix A provides SAS™ program format statements useful for formatting the
NHANES 2009-10 occupation and industry group code data. Appendix B provides
tables showing the detailed U.S. Census occupation and industry source codes
used in creating the NHANES 2009-10 occupation and industry group codes.

Detailed occupation and industry codes for the 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and
2003-2004 cycles are not available through the RDC, and at this time, there is
no timeline to release them.

NHANES is a survey of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population,
therefore by definition participants whose current job is in the active
military service are not chosen as sample participants; however, sample
participants may be civilian employees of the military or in the military
reserves or National Guard. Also, military occupation codes are pertinent to
the sample participant's longest held occupation data. If a participant states
that military service is the Longest Job, then it was coded using civilian
occupation codes. For example, "aircraft mechanic" or "electronic technician."
However, all other military-specific occupations are coded according to rank
(i.e., military enlisted personnel, first-line enlisted military supervisors,
or military officers).

The OCQ data were collected as part of the household questionnaire and
therefore the full sample NHANES interview weights WTINT2YR should be used for
statistical analysis. However, if the OCQ data are merged with the MEC exam or
laboratory data, then NHANES examination sample weights WTMEC2YR should be
used for analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

Related NHANES 2009-10 Data:

There are occupation-related items in the NHANES Physical Functioning
questionnaire (PFQ_F: PFQ049 and PFQ051) and a question on veteran's
status/military service in the Sample Participant Demographics data file
(DEMO_F: DMQMILIT). In NHANES 2009-10, Respiratory Health data was also
collected: the dataset SPX_F contains spirometry exam data; ENX_F contains
data on exhaled nitric oxide measurements; MCQ_F contains questionnaire data
on a prior medical diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease; and RDQ_F contains data on recent respiratory symptoms. Additional
resource reference material is available for other NHANES and National Center
for Health Statistics Occupation datasets (Wagener 1993).
