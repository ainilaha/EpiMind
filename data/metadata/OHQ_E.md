# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2007-2008 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Oral Health (OHQ_E)

####  Data File: OHQ_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2009

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The oral health questionnaire section (OHQ) provides personal interview data
on oral health topics. These topic areas and related target population groups
in the OHQ section include:

  * Oral Health quality of life related questions (18+ yr)
  * Dental health perception (18+ yr)

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants 18 years and older were eligible for the dental health
perception and quality of life related questions.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The Oral Health questionnaire was done before the physical examination, in the
home, using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing-CAPI (interviewer
administered) system.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Several types of quality control were implemented to ensure that high quality
data were collected during the survey.

Interviewer monitoring was a major responsibility for NCHS and contractor
staff. Interviewers were frequently accompanied on interviews and observed to
verify that the interview protocol was administered correctly. Interviewers
were retrained on survey procedures if necessary.

The interviewers are encouraged to provide comments and other suggestions,
based on their field experiences. NCHS has used field staff and interviewer
feedback to improve the questionnaires and survey materials. NCHS and
contractor staff conduct annual staff debriefing and training sessions
jointly. Interviewers are trained on new survey content and protocol changes
prior to implementation in the field.

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of responses to the questions was reviewed.

## Analytic Notes

In addition to the oral health questionnaire data, oral health examination
data can be found in the oral health section of the NHANES 2007-2008 Exam
Files (OHX). These data may be linked using the unique survey participant
identifier, SEQN. Please refer to the Oral Health Examination support
documentation for additional information related to the oral component and
oral health questions administered at the time of the oral health examination.

Although these data were collected as part of the household questionnaire, if
they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used for
the analyses.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines on the NHANES website for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic
Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
