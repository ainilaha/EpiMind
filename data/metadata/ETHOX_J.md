## Component Description

**Ethylene Oxide  **

Ethylene oxide (EO) is an important industrial chemical used in making
consumer and non-consumer products and is used as a gaseous sterilant for
medical devices. EO has been classified as a human carcinogen (Group 1) by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). EO has been detected in
exogenous sources, such as tobacco smoke, automobile exhaust, and some food
(Clin Chem, 2016). EO, is also formed endogenously in animals and humans as a
result of Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) mediated metabolic oxidation of
ethylene. It is also formed in vivo during normal physiological processes,
such as methionine oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and via the metabolic
activity of intestinal bacteria. Information on endogenous and exogenous EO
exposure in the general population is very limited and is needed to assess
potential health effects associated with this exposure and to monitor changes
in exposure over time.  

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This procedure describes a method to measure hemoglobin adducts of EO in human
whole blood or erythrocytes. Specifically, the reaction products with the
N-terminal valine of the hemoglobin protein chains (N-[2-carbamoyl ethyl]
valine and N-[2-hydroxycarbamoyl-ethyl] valine EO adducts) are measured.

This method is based on the modified Edman reaction, which uses the effect of
N-alkylated amino acids being able to form Edman products in neutral or
alkaline conditions without changing the pH to acidic conditions required in
conventional Edman reaction procedures. It was first described for N-terminal
hemoglobin adducts of EO, propylene oxide, and styrene oxide and later
optimized to increase yield of Edman products of these adducts. This optimized
method was further refined and modified in-house to increase sensitivity and
enable automation.

The procedure described here consists of 4 parts:

1.    Preparation of the specimen for measurement of hemoglobin adducts EO; 

2.    Measurement of total hemoglobin in the sample solution used for hemoglobin adduct measurements; 

3.    Modified Edman reaction in the sample solution and isolation of Edman products; and 

4.    Analysis of Edman products by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and results processing. 

Because results are reported in pmol adduct per gram of hemoglobin, the amount
of hemoglobin used for the modified Edman reaction needs to be known.
Therefore, this procedure includes a measurement procedure for total
hemoglobin. It is a commercial assay kit based on a well-established procedure
commonly used in clinical chemistry. Quantitation of the EO hemoglobin adducts
is performed using octapeptides with the same amino acid sequence as the
N-terminal of the beta-chain of hemoglobin with EO attached at the valine.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory method used.

## Laboratory Method Files

MET-508.pdf) (February 2023)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Washed-packed red blood cell specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to
the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
[NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed quality
control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

EO were measured in a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older.
Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific
sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be
used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**  
The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
ended "LC" (ex., LBDEOALC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXEOA) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDEOALC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in pmol/g Hb) for EO is:

Variable Name  |  Analyte Description |  LLOD  
---|---|---  
LBXEOA | Ethylene Oxide | 12.9
