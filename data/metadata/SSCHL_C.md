##### First Published: May 2010

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at

## Component Description

**Introduction  
**It has been proposed that racial/ethnic variation in prostate cancer
incidence may be, inÂ Â part, due to racial/ethnic variation in sex steroid
hormone levels. However, it remains unclear whether in the US population
circulating concentrations of sex steroid hormones vary by race/ethnicity. To
address this, concentrations of testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin,
androstanediol glucuronide (a metabolite of dihydrotestosterone) and estradiol
were measured in stored serum specimens from men selected for the 1/3
subsample where organochlorine pesticide levels were determined. This data
file contains results of the testing of 1554 males age 12 or more years who
were part of that sub sample and for whom serum was still available in the
repository. Data Documentation for each of these four components is given in
sections below.

**Testosterone**  
The androgen testosterone (17Ã-hydroxyandrostenone) has a molecular weight of
288 daltons. In men, testosterone is synthesized almost exclusively by the
Leydig cells of the testes. The secretion of testosterone is regulated by
luteinizing hormone (LH), and is subject to negative feedback via the
pituitary and hypothalamus. Testosterone promotes the development of the
secondary sex characteristics in men and serves to maintain the function of
the prostate and seminal vesicles. Most of the circulating testosterone is
bound to carrier proteins (SHBG = sex hormone-binding globulin). In women,
small quantities of testosterone are formed in the ovaries. In physiological
concentrations, androgens have no specific effects in women. Increased
production of testosterone in women can cause virilization (depending on the
increase). The determination of testosterone in women is helpful in the
diagnosis of androgenic syndrome (AGS), polycystic ovaries (Stein-Leventhal
syndrome) and when an ovarian tumor, adrenal tumor, adrenal hyperplasia or
ovarian insufficiency is suspected. Testosterone is determined in men when
reduced testosterone production is suspected, e.g. in hypogonadism, estrogen
therapy, chromosome aberrations (as in the Klinefelterâs syndrome) and liver
cirrhosis.

Elecsys Testosterone is based on a competitive test principle using a
monoclonal antibody specifically directed against testosterone. Endogenous
testosterone released from the sample by ANS (8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic
acid) and norgestrel competes with the added testosterone derivative labeled
with ruthenium complex for the binding sites on the biotinylated antibody.

**Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)**  
Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is the blood transport protein for
testosterone and estradiol. It is a large glycoprotein with a molecular weight
of about 95 kD, and exists as a homodimer composed of two identical subunits.
Each subunit contains two disulfide bridges. (Petra PH, 1991) Planar C18 and
C19 steroids with a 17a-hydroxyl group bind particularly well, (Avvakumov GV
et al., 2001; Hammond GL, 1995) whereas C19 17-ketosteroids such as
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstendione do not bind so easily. SHBG
has a high binding affinity to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), medium affinity to
testosterone and estradiol, and only a low affinity to estrone, DHEA,
androstendione, and estriol. SHBG binds reversibly to sexual steroids.
Albumin, which exists in far higher concentrations than SHBG, also binds
sexual steroids â although with a clearly lower binding affinity (e.g. about
100 times lower for testosterone). SHBG has a half-life of about 7 days and is
produced mainly by the liver. Its synthesis and secretion are regulated by
estrogen (Burger HG, 2002; Davis S, 2001). SHBG serum concentrations depend on
the extent, duration, and the kind of estrogen applied, and how regulation
takes place. Androgens and gestagens with androgenic residual action have the
opposite effect. In the serum SHBG mainly takes over the transportation of
steroids and the reduction/regulation of the effect of androgen. (Rosner W et
al., 1999; Burger HG et al., 2002) Decreased SHBG serum levels are associated
with conditions where elevated androgen levels are present or where the effect
of androgen on its target organs is excessive. This explains the gender-
related differences seen between men and women, especially during puberty.

Measurement of SHBG can be an important indicator of an excessive/chronic
androgenic action where androgen levels are normal, but where clinical
symptoms would seem to indicate androgen in excess. SHBG is a useful
supplementary parameter in the determination of androgen where a relatively
high concentration of free androgen (e.g. testosterone) is suspected (Pugeat M
et al., 1996).

By calculating the free androgen index (FAI), also called free testosterone
index (FTI), from the ratio of total testosterone (TT) to SHBG [% FAI or FTI =
(TT/SHBG) * 100], it is possible to calculate the approximate amount of free
testosterone (FTc), as there is a direct correlation between FAI and FT. By
additionally taking the non-specifically albumin-bound testosterone into
account, it is possible to calculate the bioavailable testosterone (BATc),
which is the sum of free testosterone and the albumin-bound testosterone
fraction, calculated via the association constant to albumin. Only free
testosterone is biologically active, and it best indicates the clinical
situation of the patient. Free and bioavailable testosterone are also referred
to as non-SHBG-bound testosterone and can be obtained by precipitation of the
SHBG-bound-testosterone with ammonium sulfate, and by equilibrium dialysis
(Vermeulen A, 1999 et al., Morley JE et al., 2002).

Elevated SHBG levels can be seen in elderly men, and are often found in
patients with hyperthyroidism and cirrhosis of the liver. SHBG levels also
increase when oral contraceptives or antiepileptic drugs are taken. Pregnant
women have markedly higher SHBG serum concentrations due to their increased
estrogen production.

Decreased SHBG concentrations are often seen with hypothyroidism, polycystic
ovarian syndrome (PCOS), obesity, hirsutism, elevated androgen levels,
alopecia, and acromegaly.

Elecsys SHBG employs two monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against
human SHBG. Cross-reactivity with ??1-fetoprotein (AFP), corticosteroid
binding globulin (CBG), DHT, estradiol, fibrinogen, human immunoglobulin A
(IgA), human immunoglobulin G (IgG), plasminogen, thyroxine binding globulin
(TBG), testosterone, thyroglobulin (Tg), transferrin, and thyrotropin (TSH) is
negligible.

Androstanediol glucuronide 5a-Androstane-3a, 17Ã-diol glucuronide is a C19
steroid and is either abbreviated as 3a Diol G, 5a Diol G or simply, a Diol G.
It is produced mainly as a metabolite of testosterone and ihydrotestosterone
(DHT). It is largely produced in target peripheral tissues such as the skin,
especially around hair follicles. The stimulation by large amounts of 3a Diol
G leads to excessive hair formation, notably where hair is not normally
present in women.

In recent years the interest in the measurement of this steroid has increased
among clinical investigators studying women suffering from idiopathic
hirsutism.

Among the steroids known to be precursors for 3a Diol G are
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS),
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), androstenedione and testosterone. Only 3a Diol G
has been shown to increase with hirsutism and decrease with treatment. This
correlation has also been demonstrated in patients with polycystic ovarian
syndrome (PCO). 3a Diol G determinations have therefore proved to be a useful
indicator in a variety of ways including monitoring the progress of treatment
of idiopathic hirsutism and women with PCO.

Furthermore, diabetic patients (both men and women) under cyclosporine A
therapy have shown increased 3a Diol G levels, a side effect resulting in the
appearance of hair in previously hairless areas.

**Estrogens  
**Estrogens are responsible for the development of the secondary female sex
characteristics. Together with gestagens they control all the important female
reproductive processes. The biologically most active estrogen is 17
Ã-estradiol. This is a steroid hormone having a molecular weight of 272
daltons. Estrogens are produced primarily in the ovary (follicle, corpus
luteum), but small quantities are also formed in the testes and in the adrenal
cortex. During pregnancy, estrogens are mainly formed in the placenta. About
98% of estradiol is bound to transport proteins (SHBG = sex hormone binding
globulin). Estrogen secretion is biphasic during the menstrual cycle. The
determination of estradiol is utilized clinically in the elucidation of
fertility disorders in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis, gynecomastia,
estrogen-producing ovarian and testicular tumors and in hyperplasia of the
adrenal cortex. Further clinical indications are the monitoring of fertility
therapy and determining the time of ovulation within the framework of in vitro
fertilization (IVF).

Elecsys Estradiol II employs a competitive test principle using a polyclonal
antibody specifically directed against 17 Ã-estradiol. Endogenous estradiol
released from the sample by mesterolone competes with the added estradiol
derivative labeled with a ruthenium complex for the binding sites on the
biotinylated antibody.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Testosterone  
**Test principle  
Competition principle. Total duration of assay: 18 minutes.

• 1st incubation: 50 µL of sample is incubated with a testosterone-specific
biotinylated antibody and a testosterone derivative labeled with a ruthenium
complex. The binding sites of the labeled antibody become occupied partly by
the sample analyte (depending on its concentration) and partly by the
ruthenium-labeled hapten to form the respective immunocomplexes.  
• 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the
complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin.  
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the
microparticles are magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode.
Unbound substances are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to
the electrode then induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a
photomultiplier.  
• Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument-
specifically generated by 2-point calibration and a master curve provided via
the reagent barcode**.**

Calibration  
Traceability: This method has been standardized via ID-GC/MS ("Isotope
Dilution Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry"). Every testosterone reagent
set has a barcoded label containing the specific information for calibration
of the particular reagent lot. The predefined master curve is adapted to the
analyzer by the use of Elecsys Testosterone CalSet II.  
Calibration frequency:Calibration must be performed once per reagent lot using
fresh reagent (i.e. not more than 24 hours since the reagent kit was
registered on the analyzer). Renewed calibration is recommended as follows:  
_Elecsys 2010:_  
• after 1 month (28 days) when using the same reagent lot

**Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)**  
Test principle  
Sandwich principle. Total duration of assay: 18 minutes.

• 1st incubation: 10 µL of sample, a biotinylated monoclonal SHBG-specific
antibody, and a monoclonal SHBG-specific antibody labeled with a ruthenium
complex form a sandwich complex.  
• 2nd incubation: After addition of streptavidin-coated microparticles, the
complex becomes bound to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and
streptavidin.  
• The reaction mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the

**Androstanediol glucuronide**  
The principle of the following enzyme immunoassay test follows the typical
competitive binding scenario. Competition occurs between an unlabeled antigen
(present in standards, control and patient samples) and an enzyme-labeled
antigen (conjugate) for a limited number of antibody binding sites on the
microwell plate. The washing and decanting procedures remove unbound
materials. After the washing step, the enzyme substrate is added. The
enzymatic reaction is terminated by addition of the stopping solution. The
absorbance is measured on a microtitre plate reader. The intensity of the
color formed is inversely proportional to the concentration of 3a Diol G in
the sample. A set of standards is used to plot a standard curve from which the
amount of 3a Diol G in patient samples and controls can be directly read.

## Data Processing and Editing

**Testosterone  
**Calculation  
The analyzer automatically calculates the analyte concentration of each sample
(either in nmol/L, ng/mL or ng/dL).

Conversion factors:  
nmol/L x 0.288 = ng/mL  
ng/mL x 3.47 = nmol/L  
ng/mL x 100 = ng/dL

**Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)  
**Calculation  
The analyzer automatically calculates the analyte concentration of each sample
either in nmol/L, Âµg/mL or mg/L (selectable).

Conversion factors:  
nmol/L x 0.095 = Âµg/mL (mg/L)  
Âµg/mL (mg/L) x 10.53 = nmol/L.

**Androstanediol glucuronide  
**Results

A. Calculate the mean absorbance for each Standard, Control or unknown.

B**.** Using a linear-log graph paper, plot the mean absorbance readings for
each of the standards along the y-axis versus the androstanediol glucuronide
concentrations in ng/mL along the x-axis.

Alternatively, any data reduction software designed for immunoassays could be
used. Four-parameter curve-fit is recommended.

C. Draw the best fitting curve through the mean of the duplicate points.

D. Determine the androstanediol glucuronide concentrations of the Controls and
unknowns from the standard curve by matching their mean absorbance readings
with the corresponding androstanediol glucuronide concentrations. _If the
absorbance reading for the first standard exceed the limitations of the plate
reader, a second reading at 405 nm is needed (reference filter 600 or 620 if
available). In this case, proceed to construct a second standard curve as
above with the absorbance readings of all Standards at 405 nm. The
concentration of the off-scale samples at 450 nm are then read from the new
standard curve. The readings at 405 nm should not replace the on-scale
readings at 450_.

We use Softmax Pro as our data reduction software.

**Estrogen  
**Calculation  
The analyzer automatically calculates the analyte concentration of each sample
(either in pmol/L, pg/mL, ng/L or additionally in nmol/L with E170).

Conversion factors:  
pmol/L x 0.273 = pg/mL (ng/L)  
pg/mL x 3.67 = pmol/L

Limitations - interference  
The assay is unaffected by icterus (bilirubin < 1129 Âµmol/L or < 66 mg/dL),
hemolysis (Hb < 0.621 mmol/L or < 1.0 g/dL), lipemia (Intralipid < 1000
mg/dL), and biotin < 147 nmol/L or < 36 ng/mL.

Criterion: Recovery within Â± 10% of initial value.

In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. > 5 mg/day), no
sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin
administration. No interference was observed from rheumatoid factors up to a
concentration of 1200 IU/mL. In vitro tests were performed on 18 commonly used
pharmaceuticals. No interference with the assay was found. The risk of
interference from potential immunological interactions between test components
and rare sera has been minimized by the inclusion of suitable additives.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

**Testosterone  
**For quality control, use Elecsys PreciControl Universal 1 and 2.

Controls are run at begin of day, after every 100 samples and at the end of
the day, at least once per reagent kit, and after every calibration. The
ranges are based on the manufacturerâs given range.

Beginning of day controls must fall within 2 SD to begin the run. We accept
the controls if they fall within 3 SD only if the previous time was within 2
SD. This criteria applies to both controls within and across runs.

**Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)  
**For quality control, use Elecsys PreciControl Universal 1 and 2.

Controls are run at begin of day, after every 100 samples and at the end of
the day, at least once per reagent kit, and after every calibration. The
ranges are based on the manufacturerâs given range.

Beginning of day controls must fall within 2 SD to begin the run. We accept
the controls if they fall within 3 SD only if the previous time was within 2
SD. This criteria applies to both controls within and across runs.

**Androstanediol glucuronide  
**Two levels of control are provided with the kit. We run each control on a
plate. Controls and samples are done in duplicate. The manufacturerâs range
is used as a guideline until we have at least 20 data points to set our own
mean and SD.

If both controls are within 2 SD â we accept the data. If one control is
within 2 SD and the other within 3 SD â we accept the data. If one or both
controls are outside 3 SD â we do not accept the results and repeat the
plate.

## Analytic Notes

**Testosterone**

Limitations - interference  
The assay is unaffected by icterus (bilirubin < 513 Âµmol/L or < 30 mg/dL),
hemolysis (Hb < 1.1 mmol/L or < 1.8 g/dL), lipemia (triglycerides < 22.8
mmol/L or < 2000 mg/dL), and biotin < 123 nmol/L or < 30 ng/mL.

Criterion: Recovery within Â± 10% of initial value.

In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. > 5 mg/day), no
sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin
administration. In vitro tests were performed on 17 commonly used
pharmaceuticals. No interference with the assay was found. In isolated cases,
elevated testosterone levels were seen in samples from female dialysis
patients > 70 years old. The risk of interference from potential immunological
interactions between test components and rare sera has been minimized by the
inclusion of suitable additives.In rare cases interference due to extremely
high titers ofantibodies to ruthenium can occur. Elecsys Testosterone contains
additives which minimize these effects. Extremely high titers of antibodies to
streptavidin can occur inisolated cases and cause interference. For diagnostic
purposes, the results should always be assessed in conjunction with the
patientâs medical history, clinical examination and other findings.

Measuring range  
0.069-52.00 nmol/L or 0.020-15.00 ng/mL (defined by the lower detection limit
and the maximum of the master curve). Values below the detection limit are
reported as < 0.069 nmol/L or < 0.020 ng/mL. Values above the measuring range
are reported as > 52.00 nmol/L or > 15.00 ng/mL.

Analytical sensitivity (lower detection limit)  
0.069 nmol/L (0.02 ng/mL)

The detection limit represents the lowest measurable analyte level that can be
distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the value lying two standard
deviations above that of the lowest standard (master calibrator, standard 1 +
2 SD, within-run precision, n = 21).

Functional sensitivity  
0.42 nmol/L (0.12 ng/mL)

The functional sensitivity is the lowest analyte concentration that can be
reproducibly measured with a between-run coefficient of variation of less than
or equal to 20%.

**Measurements below the level of detection are indicated as negative
numbers.**

**Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)**

Limitations - interference  
The assay is unaffected by icterus (bilirubin < 1026 Âµmol/L or < 60 mg/dL),
hemolysis (Hb < 1.8 mmol/L or < 2.9 g/dL), lipemia (Intralipid < 2700 mg/dL),
and biotin < 60 ng/mL.

Criterion: Recovery within Â± 10% of initial value.

In patients receiving therapy with high biotin doses (i.e. > 5 mg/day), no
sample should be taken until at least 8 hours after the last biotin
administration. No interference was observed from rheumatoid factors up to a
concentration of 1160 IU/mL.There is no high-dose hook effect at SHBG
concentrations up to 1000 nmol/L. In vitro tests were performed on 16 commonly
used pharmaceuticals. No interference with the assay was found. As with all
tests containing monoclonal mouse antibodies, erroneous findings may be
obtained from samples taken from patients who have been treated with
monoclonal mouse antibodies or have received them for diagnostic purposes. In
rare cases interference due to extremely high titers of antibodies to
ruthenium can occur.

Elecsys SHBG contains additives which minimize these effects. Extremely high
titers of antibodies to streptavidin can occur in isolated cases and cause
interference. For diagnostic purposes, the results should always be assessed
in conjunction with the patientâs medical history, clinical examination and
other findings.

Measuring range  
0.350-200 nmol/L (defined by the lower detection limit and the maximum of the
master curve). Values below the detection limit are reported as < 0.350
nmol/L.

Values above the measuring range are reported as > 200 nmol/L.

Analytical sensitivity (lower detection limit)  
0.35 nmol/L

The detection limit represents the lowest measurable analyte level that can be
distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the value lying two standard
deviations above that of the lowest standard (master calibrator, standard 1 +
2 SD, within-run precision, n = 21).

Method comparison  
A comparison of Elecsys SHBG (y) with a commercially available SHBG test (x)
using clinical samples gave the following correlations:

Number of samples measured: 109  
Passing/Bablok12 Linear regression  
y = 1.17x - 3.26 y = 1.15x - 1.82  
?? = 0.909 r = 0.981  
SD (md68) = 3.24 Sy.x = 4.15

The sample concentrations were between approx. 11.2 and 155 nmol/L.

Analytical specificity  
For the monoclonal antibodies used, non detectable cross-reactivities were
found for the following substances:  
AFP, CBG, DHT, estradiol, fibrinogen, human IgA, human IgG, plasminogen, TBG,
testosterone, Tg, transferrin, and TSH.

**Androstanediol glucuronide**

SENSITIVITY  
The lower detection limit is calculated from the standard curve by determining
the resulting concentration of the mean OD of Calibrator A (based on 10
replicate analyses) minus 2 SD. Therefore, the sensitivity of the Direct 3a
Diol G ELISA kit is 0.1 ng/ml

SPECIFICITY __(CROSS REACTIVITY  
The following compounds were tested for cross-reactivity with the Direct 3a
Diol G ELISA kit with 3a Diol G crossreacting at 100%.

Steroid %Cross Reactivity  
3a Diol G 100  
Testosterone 0.2  
Progesterone 0.16  
Androstenedione 0.14  
Cortisol 0.05

The following steroids were tested but cross-reacted at less than 0.01%:  
Corticosterone, Dehydroepiandrosterone, Dihydrotestosterone, Epiandrosterone,
17Ã-Estradiol and Estrone.

INTRA-ASSAY PRECISION  
Three samples were assayed ten times each on the same calibrator curve. The
results were < 8% CV at each level, 0.87, 6.86 and 21.26 ng/mL

INTER-ASSAY PRECISION  
Three samples were assayed ten times over a period of four weeks. The results
were 10.4, 6.5 and 10.8 %CV at 0.98, 7.05 and 20.92 ng/mL, respectively

RECOVERY  
Spiked samples were prepared by adding defined amounts of 3a Diol G to three
serum samples. The results ranged from 88 to 115%

LINEARITY  
Three serum samples were diluted with calibrator A. The results showed
linearity at dilutions of 1:2, 1:4 and 1:8****

EXPECTED NORMAL VALUES  
As for all assays each laboratory should collect data and establish their own
range of expected normal values.

Normal Range (ng/ml)  
Males 1.53-14.82  
Premenopausal 0.22-4.64  
Postmenopausal 0.61-3.71  
Puberty (Female) 0.51-4.03

**Estrogens**

Erroneous test results may be obtained from samples taken from patients who
have been exposed to vaccines containing rabbit serum or when keeping rabbits
as pet animals. In rare cases, interference due to extremely high titers of
antibodies to streptavidin and ruthenium can occur. Elecsys Estradiol II
contains additives which minimize these effects. For diagnostic purposes, the
results should always be assessed in conjunction with the patientâs medical
history, clinical examination and other findings.

Measuring range  
18.4-15,781 pmol/L (5.00-4300 pg/mL) (defined by the lower detection limit and
the maximum of the master curve). Values below the detection limit are
reported as < 18.4 pmol/L or < 5.00 pg/mL. Values above the measuring range
are reported as > 15,781 pmol/L or > 4300 pg/mL (or up to 78,905 pmol/L or
21,500 pg/mL for 5-fold diluted samples).

Analytical sensitivity (lower detection limit)  
18.4 pmol/L (5.0 pg/mL)

The detection limit represents the lowest analyte level that can be
distinguished from zero. It is calculated as the value lying two standard
deviations above that of the lowest standard (master calibrator, standard 1 +
2 SD, within-run precision, n = 21).

Functional sensitivity  
44 pmol/L (12 pg/mL)

The functional sensitivity is the lowest analyte concentration that can be
reproducibly measured with a between-run coefficient of variation of = 20%.
