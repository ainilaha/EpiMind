### Fatty Acids - Serum (FAS_G)

####  Data File: FAS_G.xpt

##### First Published: January 2019

##### Last Revised: February 2020

## Component Description

The analysis of individual plasma or serum fatty acids is important in the
recognition of essential fatty acid deficiency (Siguel E. 1998) and in the
differential diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism, such as mitochondrial
fatty acid oxidation disorders (Costa, et al. 1998; Jones, et al. 2000; Moser,
et al. 1998). Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential for normal
development (Hamosh, et al. 1998). The dietary content of saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids influence the concentration
of cholesterol in low-density and high-density lipoproteins, and consequently
the development of atherosclerosis (O'Keefe, et al. 1995). Regular consumption
of or supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids can have
beneficial effects on long-term cardiovascular health due to anti-inflammatory
and possibly antiarrhythmic effects (Kang, et al. 1996). The goal of this
method is to obtain US reference ranges for most circulating fatty acids.
Public health recommendations advise increasing or decreasing the intake of
various classes of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated)
but relatively little fatty acid biomarker data exist to support these
recommendations and reference range data are scarce.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 11 and participants aged 12 and over who
were examined in the morning session were eligible.  

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Esterified fatty acids are hydrolyzed primarily from triglycerides,
phospholipids and cholesteryl esters using sequential treatment with mineral
acid and base in the presence of heat. Using a modification of (Lagerstedt, et
al. 2001), total fatty acids are hexane-extracted from the matrix (100uL serum
or plasma) along with an internal standard solution containing eighteen stable
isotopically-labeled fatty acids to account for recovery.  The extract is
derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) in the presence of
triethylamine to form pentafluorobenzyl esters.  The reaction mixture is
injected onto a capillary gas chromatograph column to resolve individual fatty
acids of interest from other matrix constituents.  Fatty acids are detected
using electron capture negative-ion mass spectrometry within 34 minutes.
Thirteen saturated, seven monounsaturated, and fifteen polyunsaturated fatty
acids (thirty-five fatty acids in total) are measured using selected ion
monitoring.  Quantitation is accomplished by comparing the peak area of the
analyte in the unknown with the peak area of a known amount in a calibrator
solution.  Calculations are corrected based on the peak area of the internal
standard in the unknown compared with the peak area of the internal standard
in the calibrator solution.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2011-2012 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Fatty Acids -
Serum](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/labmethods/FAS_G_MET.PDF)
(January 2019)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for testing.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they were
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained."

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed.  Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2011-2012 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2011-2012, approximately 79% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES
[Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/NHANES/index_continuous.htm) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample weights**

The appropriate sample weights are provided in the variable WTFAS2YR in this
data file for all participants and should be used when analyzing these data.

Serum fatty acids were measured for all examined participants aged 3 to 11
years, and a fasting subsample of participants 12 years and older. For
participants aged 3 to 11 years, their WTFAS2YR are equivalent to their MEC
exam sample weights. These participants have completed at least one physical
exam component in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample weight
larger than "0," regardless of their lab test results. For participants 12
years and older, special sample weights were created for the subsample. These
special weights accounted for the additional probability of selection into the
subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if participants 12 years and older were selected as part of the
fasting subsample but did not provide a blood specimen, they would have the
subsample weight value assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/FASTQX_G.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDCAPLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., LBXCAP) provides the analytic
result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., LBDCAPLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in µmol/L) for serum fatty acids:

Previous survey cycles provided limited information on selected fatty acids.
Plasma fatty acids were measured in NHANES 2003-2004 as part of a surplus
specimen project. Please see the NHANES web site for descriptions of the
[2003-2004 surplus specimen fatty acid
data.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2003-2004/SSFA_C.htm)
