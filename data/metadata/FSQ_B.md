### Food Security (FSQ_B)

####  Data File: FSQ_B.xpt

#####  First Published: November 2004

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Food Security section (FSQ) covers a variety of areas relating to lack of
adequate food and receipt of food assistance in various forms. FSQ items were
included in various parts of the NHANES survey, both in the household
interview and in the Mobile Exam Center (MEC). These are listed and described
separately.

**U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (FSSM)**

The 18-item module, formerly known as the "Core food security module" was
administered to one adult in a household, even if there was more than one
family in the household. The questions referred to all household members, even
if they were not individual participants in NHANES. The FSSM has been used on
many other surveys, including the Current Population Survey (CPS), whose
results are used to provide an estimate of the percent of US households that
is food insecure and that experiences hunger.

Interview setting: Home  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: All households, but high income households were screened out
of the questions. One adult responds.  
Release level: All household members

**Food program participation**

NHANES included questions on receipt of benefits from the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), food stamp receipt,
and reduced price or free school meals. Data on subsidized school meals are
released with the Diet Behavior section (DBQ); WIC and food stamp data are
included in this FSQ release. Questions about WIC were asked at the household
level and at the individual child and mother level.

WIC: Household received  
Interview setting: Home  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: All households with a child 0-5 and/or a woman 12-59years.
One adult responds.  
Release level: All household members

WIC: Child received  
Interview setting: Home  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: Children 0-5 years old. Adult responds.  
Release level: Individual child

WIC: Mother received Interview setting: Mobile Exam Center  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: Women pregnant, lactating, or within 6 months of giving
birth. Woman responds.  
Release level: Individual woman

Food Stamps: How many in household authorized  
Interview setting: Home  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: All households. One adult responds.  
Release level: All household members

Food Stamps: Individual authorized; how many months, currently  
authorized Interview setting: Home  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: All household members. One adult responds. Release level:
Individual beneficiary

**Individual Food Security**

NHANES 2001-2002 included questions for children and adults on their
individual experience of food insecurity. The questions are derived from a
subset of those asked at the household level in the FSSM. Adults are asked 5
questions, with 2 follow-ups about frequency; 5 questions with 1 frequency
follow-up are asked for children. This is the first time these questions have
been included in a national survey.

Interview setting: Mobile Exam Center  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: Children under 12; adults/ teens 16 years and over  
Release level: Individual adult or child

## Data Processing and Editing

**Data collection**

**Food Adequacy Indicator**

The USDA food adequacy indicator (FSD.010) was asked of only a subset of
households and these data are not released

**Food Security Survey Module (FSSM)**

NHANES 2001-2002 contains the 18-item U.S. Food Security Survey Module
(formerly known as the Core Module) which is used in numerous surveys,
including the Current Population Survey (CPS) and is the basis for national
level reports of food insecurity and hunger. This module was part of the
family interview but was asked at the household level and answered by one
adult respondent, even if there were multiple families in the household. Not
all households screened into the FSSM. Screening into the module was based
upon response to the USDA food adequacy indicator and/or income. Screens
within the module itself were based on answers to prior questions. Screens
were not always implemented consistently, because of computer programming
errors and glitches as well as procedural changes. Data are released in four
categories: Food secure, marginally food secure, food insecure without hunger,
food insecure with hunger.

**WIC**

A question about receipt of any WIC benefits in the past 12 months was asked
in the family interview. The question was asked about the entire household and
was answered by one adult respondent, even if there were multiple families in
the household. Questions about an individual child participant's WIC benefits
- past 12 months, current, and duration- were asked in the diet behavior
section (DBQ) of the interview and were answered by an adult respondent.
Children up to 5 years of age were eligible. Women who were pregnant,
lactating, or within 6 months of birth were asked about WIC benefits in the
MEC, as part of the Reproductive Health Section (RHQ). Household, child, and
mother data on receipt of WIC benefits are released.

**Food Stamps**

Questions about authorization to receive food stamps in the past 12 months
were included in the FSQ section of the family interview and were answered by
one adult respondent. The questions asked about authorization for anyone in
the household, who in the household was authorized, how many months in the
past 12 months the person was authorized, and whether the person was now
authorized. Data are released on number of people in household authorized for
food stamps, individual authorization, number of months received in past 12
months, and current authorization. Individual data are not available for all
participants.

**Individual Food Security**

Questions on an individual's experience of food insecurity were asked for
children under 12 years and adults 16 years and over residing in households
that had reported an experience of household-level food insecurity in the
family interview, defined as a positive response to one or more of the first 5
FSSM questions. The individual-referenced questions were asked following the
dietary recall in the MEC. Proxies responded for children, adults responded
for themselves. The questions were a subset of those asked at the household
level in the FSSM. Adults were asked 5 questions, with 2 follow-ups about
frequency; proxies for children were asked 5 questions with 1 frequency
follow-up. Data are released on that individual's record.

**Data Editing**

**Food Security Survey Module (FSSM)**

When screening procedures and skips operated correctly, respondents with no
prior affirmative responses and/or high income were skipped out of some
subsequent questions. Responses to the subsequent questions were coded as
negative.

Where data were missing for a specific item not resulting from a valid skip,
results were imputed when possible, using the instructions for imputing given
in the "Guide to Measuring Household Food Security, Revised 2000." Series of
truly missing data could not be imputed and were left as missing. Data for
child-referenced items were not imputed if none were answered.

Screening for entry into the Food Security Survey Module varied over the two
years, using response to the USDA food adequacy indicator or reported income
to screen out some households. Households screened out of questions were
presumed to have responded negatively to all FSSM items.

Several of the internal screens in the FSSM did not always work correctly.
Where possible, the data were edited to simulate these screens. Where this was
not possible, data are missing.

FSSM responses were used to create three categorical measures of food security
for households with children and two for households without children.

The household measure uses all 18 items (or 10 items for households without
children) in a manner consistent with the CPS categorical measure, depicted on
page 31 of the "Guide to Measuring Household Food Security, Revised 2000"
<http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsec/FILES/FSGuide.pdf>. The four categories created
for household food security are: food secure, marginally food secure ("at
risk" in the guide), food insecure without hunger, and food insecure with
hunger (moderate and severe hunger have been combined into one category).

The adult measure uses 10 items to create four response categories. These
categories are the same as those used for the household measure, but they
utilize only the household and adult items and label names differ slightly.
The adult measure is scored the same as the household scale for households
with adults only (uses 10 items), whether or not there are children in the
household. Thus, for adult-only households, the household and adult measures
are identical.

It is further described in documentation on the Survey of Program Dynamics
<http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/FoodSecurity/spd/spd98.pdf> and
<http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/FoodSecurity/spd/spd01.pdf>.  

The child measure categorization is based upon the ERS research report
"Measuring Children's Food Security in U.S. Households, 1995-99"
(<http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/fanrr25/fanrr25.pdf>), which uses the 8
child-referenced items to classify households into two categories (no or
insufficient evidence of hunger; clear evidence of hunger). However, the
NHANES data are grouped into four categories, for consistency with the
household and adult measures. The first category in the ERS report is
separated into three categories (food quantity and quality unaffected (0),
marginally food secure (1), and food insecure without hunger 2-4). The most
severe category is scored the same as that in the ERS report: but labeled
"child food insecure with hunger (5-8)."

**WIC**

Responses to questions about the duration of receipt of WIC benefits for
children (FSQ.655) were categorized into ≤ 6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24, 25-30,
31-36, and ≥ 37 months. Durations that appeared to be mis-entered (e.g. in
years rather than months) were edited. When children's ages and length of WIC
benefits were in different categories, the data were coded as missing.

**Food Stamps**

Computer programming errors resulted in some missing data on how many months
each person was authorized to receive food stamps, and whether the person was
currently authorized. These data could not be imputed and remain missing. A
household level variable was created containing the number of people in the
household receiving food stamps. This can be used in conjunction with the
variable for the total number of people in the household to calculate the
percentage of household members receiving food stamps.

**Individual food security**

Data for people who were not asked the individual-referenced food security
questions in the MEC because of negative responses to food security questions
in the household interview have been coded as missing, but should be
considered negative responses for most analytic purposes. Those who should
have been asked questions but were not because of programming glitches are
also coded as missing - these are true missings. Three items (two adult and
one child) have follow-up questions on how many days a meal was skipped or
cut, or an adult didn't eat. Questions asking how many days a person had gone
without food, or a meal was cut or skipped, were coded as missing if the
response to the base question was no. They were also coded as missing if the
base question was missing. If responses to all initial individual-referenced
questions were negative, the question about going a whole day without food was
not asked but was coded as negative.

## Analytic Notes

**Notes on Data Collection, Data Release, and Data Analysis**

The implementation of the Food Security Survey Module in NHANES was not always
identical to its implementation in the CPS due to a programming error. For
some participants, the items used for screening into the children's questions
(FSQ.110, 120, 140, 145) were the more severe adult questions (FSQ.070, 080,
and 090) rather than the less severe ones used in the CPS (FSQ.030f, 040, 060,
070, 080). Thus, some participants who should have been asked these questions
were not. No responses could be imputed for these items so these data are
missing. Consequently, households that were fully food secure are over-
represented in the sample with valid data at the household, adult, and child
level and should not be used for prevalence estimates.

Similarly, there were some people who should have received the individual-
referenced food security questions in the MEC who did not, again due to
programming errors. These people have missing data. It is important NOT to
consider that these missing responses are negative; they are true missings.
People who were not asked these questions because of prior negative responses
were also coded as missing, but for most analytic purposes their responses
should be considered as NEGATIVE responses. These two very different
categories of missing responses can be identified by cross-classification with
the household food security measure HHfdsec. Households that are fully food
secure on HHfdsec (i.e., had no affirmative responses) were correctly screened
out of the individual-referenced food security questions, and their responses
may be considered as NEGATIVE. Households for which HHfdsec was missing were
correctly screened out of the individual-referenced food security questions,
but their responses to those questions should also be considered MISSING.
Households for which HHfdsec was 2, 3, or 4 (marginally food secure or food
insecure) and for which all individual-referenced food security questions are
missing were incorrectly screened out of the individual-referenced food
security questions or did not answer these questions and their responses to
those questions should be considered MISSING.

Because of the programming errors, it is not valid to use these data to
estimate the prevalence of individual food security, since only a subset of
people who should have been asked these questions were, in fact, asked. These
data are best suited to correlational analyses, with elimination of records of
people who should have received the individual-referenced questions but did
not, identified by missing values on the individual-referenced items and a
response of 2-4 for household food security (HHfdsec). In addition, it is
important to distinguish between missing responses for the number of times
something happened due to a negative responses to the prior question (in which
case the number could be considered zero), and missing responses that are
truly missing.

Some responses to a question about emergency food use were considered invalid.
Interviewers reported that people misunderstood the phrase "eat in a community
kitchen" to include eating at a community senior center or other type of
community center, not one specifically for people without food, more commonly
called a "soup kitchen." Analyses of the data confirmed numerous positive
responses to the question by people who reported no food problems in earlier
questions. Therefore, these data are not released.  
When a screening procedure within the Food Security Survey Module did not work
correctly, but data could be used to impute "presumed negative" responses,
this was done. However data could not be generated for respondents who should
have been asked a series of questions but weren't. In these cases, the FSSM
measures are coded as missing.

Categorical variables for household, adult, and child food security scales
have been constructed and are released. Because of confidentiality concerns,
data from the FSSM are not released as responses to specific items nor as
scale values. Responses to questions about duration of receipt of WIC benefits
for a mother for her last pregnancy and for a child sometimes exceeded the
length allowed (pregnancy plus one year if lactating for a mother, 5 years for
a child). Interviewers believe that mothers may not be able to distinguish
well between their food and their child's food, and that they sometimes
receive food continuously because of consecutive pregnancies. Reasons for
child errors may also be confusion of one child's benefits with another's, or
mistaken entry. NCHS staff did not edit the length of use data for women but
the data were categorized.

Errors occurred in the collection of details about food stamp receipt. Data
are complete on receipt by 1) anyone in a household and 2) each individual
household member, however follow-up details are not available for some
individuals.

In data analysis and interpretation, it is important to take account of the
level at which the data were collected and are released. Individual mother and
child WIC data, individual food stamp data, and individual food security data
are all released on an individual participant's record only. However, the
household level WIC variable, food stamp variable, and the three food security
scales (household, adult, and child) are all released on the record of every
individual in the household. These variables do not necessarily reflect the
status of any one individual unless that person is the only child, adult, or
person in the household. Thus, it would not be appropriate to use the FSSM
data, for example, to estimate the prevalence of children or adults
experiencing hunger in the US. Further, because of some errors in the FSSM
data collection and the relatively small sample size, the Current Population
Survey (CPS) data are more appropriate for estimating the number of children
or adults living in households that are classified as experiencing hunger. The
NHANES data are best suited for analyses which examine household food security
in relation to health and nutritional status, and the individual-referenced
data would be expected to strengthen associations. Similarly, small sample
size for food stamp data make them best suited for analyses of association
rather than prevalence estimates.
