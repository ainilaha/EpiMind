### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA - Vaginal Swab: Roche Cobas & Roche Linear
Array (HPVSWR_H)

####  Data File: HPVSWR_H.xpt

##### First Published: December 2016

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexually
transmitted infections in the United States. Cervical infection with certain
types of HPV is a major risk factor for cervical cancer in women. The "high-
risk" types of HPV (e.g., HPV 16, 18) are associated with cervical cancer as
well as other anogenital cancers and other types (e.g., HPV 6, 11) with
genital warts. No national surveillance system exists to measure the full
burden of HPV infection, and no reliable national population estimate of HPV
exists. NHANES offers a unique opportunity to assess the prevalence of HPV
infection in the general population.

Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Developmental Healthy People
2010 objective: "Reducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the
overall number of cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer
in females..." Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs will allow
evaluation of trends in prevalence of type-specific HPV infection by age,
sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity. Three HPV vaccines (Gardasil, Gardasil 9,
and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use in girls and women. Two
vaccines are licensed and recommended for use in males (Gardasil and Gardasil
9). In mid-2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunizations (ACIP), recommended
routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and for those 13-26 years
not previously vaccinated. In December, 2011 ACIP recommended routine
vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and for those aged 13 through 21
years not previously vaccinated. As vaccine becomes more widely used, the
national prevalence of HPV infection will be critical for evaluating
vaccination strategies in the United States.

## Eligible Sample

Examined female participants aged 14-59 years and older were eligible. The
public data file includes data for persons aged 18-59 years. Please see
Analytic Notes about the release of data for adolescents aged 14-17 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Roche Cobas HPV DNA Test**

LBXHP2C (Cobas HPV Swab High Risk Result)

DNA extraction is performed with a modified protocol and the commercial QIAamp
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Presence of high-risk HPV in the extracted patient
DNA is determined with the Cobas Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Test. This
qualitative in-vitro diagnostics test uses oligonucleotide probes labeled with
four different fluorescent dyes. The primers target a DNA region of
approximately 200 nucleotides within the polymorphic L1 region of the HPV
genome to detect 14 high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52,
56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) in a single analysis. The test reports concurrently the
presence of one or more of these types at clinically relevant infection
levels, however the test has been modified from the FDA approved format
(sample type and extraction) and results cannot be used clinically.

**Roche Linear Array Assay**

This assay uses Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping test that is based on HPV L1
consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with biotinylated PGMY09/11 primer
sets. It also includes biotinylated β-globin primers as an internal control
for sample amplification. The primer mix amplifies essentially all HPV types
found in the genital tract along with the human β-globin gene. After
amplification the samples are typed by hybridization to the typing strips
followed by colorimetric detection. The strip is a linear array of probes
specific for 37 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51,
52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81,
82, 83, 84, 89, and IS39) and for the positive β-globin control as well. Types
are read by comparing the reaction pattern to the typing template. Samples
that are negative for HPV and the β-globin control indicate lack of a suitable
sample and are considered inadequate for interpretation.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Vaginal swab specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to Chronic Viral
Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology,
National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Swabs are stored at room temperature until they are shipped to Chronic Viral
Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology for
analysis.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in
the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of
concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013 - 2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Sample Weights**

MEC exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

**NHANES Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data, health indicators,
and other related information collected during household interviews. Certain
sensitive data on respondents under 18 years of age (e.g. HPV typing results,
sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files. These
data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines.

**Roche Cobas HPV DNA Test**

The Roche Cobas HPV test is qualitative and only determines the presence or
absence of high-risk HPV. If any analyte HPV 16, HPV 18 or Other High-risk is
indicated as positive (POS) in the Cobas result file the result for the sample
ID will be recorded as positive. If all of the HPV analytes are negative (NEG)
in the Cobas result file the result for the sample ID will be recorded as
negative. If any of the analytes are indicated as invalid in the Cobas result
file, the DNA from that sample will be re-tested one time to obtain valid
results. If the repeated result are still invalid the final result will be
recorded as invalid.

**HPV PCR Assay**

**HPV Summary Variable**

The HPV PCR Summary variable (LBDRPCR) indicates if at least one type is
positive (LBDRPCR=1), the sample is negative (LBDRPCR=2), the sample is
inadequate (LBDRPCR=3), or the sample is missing (LBDRPCR=.).

If beta-globin is not present (both LBDRHP and LBDRLP are negative) in the
sample and no HPV type is detected, the sample is coded as inadequate.

If any of the types on the strips (LBDR06-LBDRPI) are positive, the sample is
coded as positive. If all of the types on the strip are coded as negative, and
beta-globin is detected (either LBDRHP or LBDRLP is positive) the sample is
coded as negative.

Variables LBDRHP through LBDRPI are from the RUO Roche Linear Array HPV typing
assay, however LBDR52 also includes information from a type-specific assay for
HPV 52. The Linear Array typing strip includes an XR probe that hybridizes
with HPV 52 as well as HPV types 33, 35 and 58. Samples positive for the XR
probe and 33, 35, or 58 require specific testing to confirm the presence of
HPV 52.

**Detection Limits**

** ** Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower LLODs
is not applicable.

**Data Access**

The public release data file includes HPV data for participants aged 18-59\.
Data for youth aged 14-17 years are available through the [NCHS Research Data
Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).
