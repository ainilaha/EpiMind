### Occupation (OCQ)

####  Data File: OCQ.xpt

##### First Published: January 2008

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Occupation Questionnaire Section (prefix OCQ; questions OCQ130 to  
OCD480) contains personal interview data on employment and variables  
relating to the work environment.

## Eligible Sample

The OCQ Questionnaire was administered to Sample Persons 12+ years of age.
Sample Persons aged 12-15 years were only asked a single question (OCQ130)
that collected data on the average hours worked per week. For minors,
questions were answered via a proxy respondent, generally a parent or
guardian. Survey respondents 16 years of age and older were asked the full
series of Occupation-related questions (OCQ150-OCQ450). If in addition survey
respondents were ages 16-59 and had a history of medical provider diagnosis of
asthma (MCQ010=1) then they were eligible for the "Asthma Job" series of
questions (OCQ470G-OCD480). Note that military occupations are not permissible
entries for NHANES current job data because the survey samples solely the
civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. Military occupation codes
are, however, valid entries for both the longest or "asthma job" data.

## Data Processing and Editing

A subject's questionnaire interview responses were entered into a pentop
computer and then uploaded into a computerized database in the same manner as
other sections of the Sample Person Questionnaire. The data was then edited
for completeness, consistency, and illogical values. Industry and occupation
text data were then coded by trained nosologists using NCHS standards (DVS-
NCHS, 1997 a, b). For public release, recoded variables for industry and
occupation groups were constructed, closely following the pattern established
for reporting industry and occupation groups in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III). These Occupation and Industry
Groups and their 3-digit source codes are listed in Appendix B.

## Analytic Notes

In general, analysts are advised to carefully review question wording in the
OCQ codebook to make sure they understand the definitions employed for
Occupation-related variables. Many OCQ questions need to be considered as an
integral part of data collection for other Questionnaire sections (AUQ, HIQ,
SMQ) and Exam or Laboratory Components (AU, Lab 7-Latex). Appendix A lists a
SASâ„¢ program to provide value labels for the Industry and Occupation groups
designated for the Sample Person's Current, Longest, and "Asthma" jobs.

**Current Job Information:**

The primary focus of the OCQ Questionnaire is data collection for the Sample
Person's work within the previous week, i.e. the respondent's Current Job. The
Sample Person's Current Job is defined as the main paid job worked within the
last week, including work on a family farm. When an individual currently
worked multiple jobs, the Sample Person was asked to designate a main job for
the interview.

**Data collected included:**

  * The Number of Hours Worked Last Week- All Jobs 
  * Whether the Sample Person Usually Works 35 or More Hours/Week 
  * The Current Job Industry and Occupation Group Codes (OCD230, OCD240) 
  * Sector Of Employment (Private, Public) for Current, Main Job 
  * Number Of Months Working On Current, Main Job 
  * (If not working) The Main Reason the Respondent Did Not Work Last Week 

**Longest Job Information:**

By design, the survey collected data on both industry and occupation for a
subject's Current and "Asthma" job, but only data on occupation was collected
for the subject's Longest job. Therefore industry information is not available
for the Sample Person's designated Longest Job. Some industry information is
available in instances where the Longest Job is the same as the Current Job,
or was the armed forces (OCD390G=2 or 3). Also, in some instances industry for
the Longest job can be inferred from the Sample Person's longest occupation.
Previous survey research has shown a moderate correlation exists between a
respondent's Current and Longest reported jobs (Burnettand Crouse, 1989). The
variable OCD390 contains the Occupation Group Code Data for the Longest Job
and OCD395 contains data on the duration of the Longest Job in months.

**"Asthma" Job Information:**

For respondents reporting a diagnosis of asthma (MCQ010=1), the industry and
occupation designation for the specific job held when the asthma began were
captured. This employment history may be, but is not necessarily related to
the onset of a Sample Person's asthma. OCQ470G, the "gate" question for this
series, records whether this "Asthma" Job was the same as the respondent's
Current or Longest job, or if the respondent was not working at that time. If
the respondent was working, but not with either the Current or Longest
designated job, the variables OCD470 and OCD480 record the pertinent Industry
and Occupation Group Code information.

**Data on Workplace Tobacco Smoke Exposure:**

Data for exposure to workplace tobacco smoke is collected only for the Sample
Person's Current Job. Exposure to tobacco smoke is defined as whether the
respondent can smell tobacco smoke at work. OCQ290G records (categorically)
whether the sample person was exposed to tobacco smoke at work . If there is a
history of workplace tobacco smoke exposure OCQ290Q records the number of
hours/day the sample person was exposed. Note that a value of "0" in OCQ290Q
signifies that workplace exposure to tobacco smoke occurred, but was less than
one hour per day. Workplace tobacco smoke exposure data is logically related
to SMQ Questionnaire data.

**Data on the Use of Personal Protective Equipment at Work:**

This is the question series OCQ300 to OCQ330e, which asked about data only for
the Participant's Current Job. Data is collected on whether the Sample Person
has ever used protective equipment at work, including the use of respirators,
hearing protection, or protective glove use. The data on latex protective
glove use is designed to be analyzed with Lab 7 Latex-specific IGE antibody
data.

**Workplace Noise Exposure History:**

For the NHANES Survey, workplace noise exposure is defined as on-the-job  
noise so loud that the Sample Person has to speak in a raised voice to be
heard. Data analysts should be aware that the Sample Person's history of
hearing disorders as well as the Sample Person's exposure history for non-
occupational loud noise (i.e. from firearms, power tools or loud music), as
well as the non-occupational use of hearing protection is located in the AUQ
questionnaire segment.

**Lifetime Work Noise Exposures:**

Data on lifetime exposure to loud job noise for greater than 3 months is
collected  
in OCQ340 and OCQ420, which must be combined for any overall analysis  
(OCQ340 collects this data for the currently employed; OCQ420 collects the  
data for Sample Persons not currently employed).

**Workplace Noise in Current Job:**

For the Sample Person's Current Job, OCQ350 collects data on the presence or
absence of job noise exposure, and OCQ360 collects the average number of
hours/week. The use of hearing protection devices on the Sample Person's
Current Job is collected in OCQ310B.

**Noise Exposure in the Sample Person 's Longest Job: **

For the Sample Person's Longest Job, exposure to loud job noise for greater
than 3 months is collected in the series OCQ430, OCQ440 and OCQ450
(presence/absence of exposure; hours/day exposed; and whether protective
hearing devices were worn, respectively). The duration of the Sample Person's
Longest Job is recorded in OCD395.

**Other Notes:**

No detailed job history information for adolescents aged 12-15 years was  
collected in NHANES; only the average work hours/week was collected  
(OCQ130).

OCQ280 asks Sample Persons whether Health Insurance is offered at the
individual's Current Job. This question was placed in the OCQ Questionnaire to
facilitate the interviewing process, and is analytically a part of the Health
Insurance Questionnaire (HIQ) segment.

A detailed review and discussion of previous Occupational data for previous
NHANES surveys, as well as other National Center for Health Statistics Surveys
is available (Wagener, 1993).

**NCHS Research Data Center**

Analyses requiring additional detail of occupation or industry coding than
those publicly released are restricted because of the confidentiality of
NHANES data. Proposals for such analyses must be submitted to the NHCS
Research Data Center (RDC) for review and approval.

**Notes:**

The above industry and occupation group codes were applied to the recoded
group variables OCD230, OCD240, OCD390, OCD470, and OCD480. This schema for
occupation and industry groupings closely follows, and is directly comparable
to the pattern used in NHANES III. NHANES1999+, unlike NHANES III, has grouped
codes for military occupations and military service as an industry
designation. NHANES1999+ is a survey of the U.S. civilian, non-
institutionalized population, therefore by definition these military industry
and occupation codes cannot apply to current job data. The codes are, however,
pertinent to subject responses for the longest occupation, and the job when
asthma began.
