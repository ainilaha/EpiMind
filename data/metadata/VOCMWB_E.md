### Volatile Organic Compounds - Trihalomethanes/MTBE/Nitromethane - Blood
(VOCMWB_E)

####  Data File: VOCMWB_E.xpt

#####  First Published: May 2016

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Both the lab data and questionnaire items will be released in this file.

**Volatile Organic Compound Questions  
**  
The volatile organic compound section of the Mobile Examination Center (MEC)
Interview and Phlebotomy Component (PH) provide personal interview data.

**Volatile Organic Compounds (Whole Blood) - Trihalomethanes/MTBE/Nitromethane  
**  
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large group of chemicals that have
been used as solvents, degreasers, and cleaning agents in industry and
consumer products. Many of the VOCs were found to contaminate ground water and
drinking water sources, and because of human health concerns, have been banned
or restricted from most uses.

The prevalence of disinfection by-products in drinking water supplies has
raised concerns about possible adverse health effects from chronic exposure to
these potentially carcinogenic compounds. Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was
used as an additive to replace lead in gasoline, but its use was banned after
widespread ground water contamination was discovered.

Inhalation is the most common VOC route of exposure in the general population,
including: indoor sources, such as paints, adhesives, cleaning solutions, and
aerosolized insecticide sprays; industries producing these solvents; and
contaminated waste disposal sites. Drinking water may contribute to exposure
when underground drinking water supplies are contaminated. After they are
absorbed in the body, VOCs are rapidly eliminated in exhaled breath, or may be
rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-half sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Interview Setting and Mode of Administration**  
The questions were asked during the physical examination, in the mobile
examination center (MEC). The questions were administered by the phlebotomist
or the MEC interviewers.

**Laboratory Methodology**  
Trihalomethanes (THMs), nitromethane (NM: biomarker for halonitromethanes),
and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) are measured in whole blood by solid phase
microextraction/gas chromatography/isotope dilution mass spectrometry
(SPME/GC/isotope dilution MS) based on the method described by Bonin, et al.
The method is applicable to the determination of five VOCs in 3-mL samples of
whole blood with detection limits in the low parts per trillion (pptr) range.
Since non-occupationally exposed individuals have blood VOC concentrations in
this range, the method is applicable for determining these quantities and
investigating cases of low-level exposure to VOCs.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2007-2008 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Trihalomethanes/MTBE/Nitromethane](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2007-2008/labmethods/VOCMWB_E_met_Trihalomethanes_MTBE_Nitromethane.pdf)
(May 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=2007).
Vials are stored under appropriate refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions until they
are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health, for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=2007).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories  
**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the CDC/NCEH Tobacco and Volatile Branch quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2007-2008 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2007)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**  
Whole blood VOCs were measured in a one-half subsample of persons 12 years and
older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Some records have a 0 weight because additional VOC results were obtained
after the construction of the sample weights for this component. For
assistance in modifying the weights for analysis, please contact DHANES.**

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2007-2008 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2007)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Laboratory&CycleBeginYear=2007)
includes auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of
venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection limits**

The detection limits were constant in the data set. Two variables are provided
for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in "LC" (ex., LBDVBFLC)
indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: "0" means that
the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. For analytes with analytic results
below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBDVBFLC=1), an imputed fill value
was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable
prefixed LBX (ex., LBXVBF) provides the analytic result for that analyte.
