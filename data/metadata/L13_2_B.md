## Component Description

The goals of this component are:

  1. to monitor the prevalence and trends in major cardiovascular conditions and risk factors in the U.S.; and 
  2. to evaluate prevention and treatment programs targeting cardiovascular disease in the U.S. 

The main element of the cardiovascular disease laboratory component in NHANES
is blood lipid levels. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in
the United States. The data will be used to monitor the status of
hyperlipidemia and the success of the National Cholesterol Education Program.

**See the General Documentation on Second Day Laboratory Exams**. Also, see
the documentation for the primary exam data for Lab 13 and Lab 13AM.

## Eligible Sample

Participants agedÂ 16-69 who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria were
sampled.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Total Cholesterol**

Cholesterol is measured enzymatically in serum or plasma in a series of
coupled reactions that hydrolyze cholesteryl esters and oxidize the 3-OH group
of cholesterol. One of the reaction byproducts, H2O2 is measured
quantitatively in a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction that produces a color.
Absorbance is measured at 500 nm. The color intensity is proportional to
cholesterol concentration. The reaction sequence is as follows:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
cholesteryl ester hydrolase  
Cholesteryl ester + H2O ------------------------------------->cholesterol +
fatty acid

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â cholesterol oxidase  
Cholesterol + O2 \----------------------------> cholest-4-en-3-one + H2O2

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â peroxidase  
2H2O2 \+ 4-aminophenazone + phenol ---------------------> 4-(p-benzoquinone  
monoimino)-phenazone + 4 H2O

**HDL-Cholesterol**

In NHANES 2001-2002, HDL-cholesterol was measured using two methods. A
heparin-manganese (Mn) precipitation method and a direct immunoassay technique
were used. The heparin-Mn method was used for participants ages 6 years and
above. The direct method is used for participantsÂ with no heparin-manganese
HDL-cholesterol values, usually as a result of limited sample volume. HDL-
cholesterol values less than 40 mg/dL are associated with increased coronary
heart disease risk in adults.

**Heparin-Mn Precipitation Method**

Apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins are removed by precipitation with
heparin sulfate and MnCl2 and cholesterol is measured in the HDL-containing
supernatant. Cholesterol in the HDL-containing supernatant is measured as
described above for total cholesterol.

**HDL-Cholesterol Direct Immunoassay Method**

HDL is measured directly in serum. The apolipoprotein B containing
lipoproteins in the specimen are reacted with a blocking reagent that renders
them non-reactive with the enzymatic cholesterol reagent under conditions of
the assay.

The reagents are purchased from Roche/Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics. The
method uses sulfated alpha-cyclodextrin in the presence of Mg+2 , which forms
complexes with apoB containing lipoproteins, and polyethylene glycol-coupled
cholesteryl esterase and cholesterol oxidase for the HDL-cholesterol
measurement. The reactions are as follows:

apoB containing lipoproteins + a-cyclodextrin + Mg+2 \+ dextran SO4 \--->
soluble non-reactive complexes with apoB-containing lipoproteinsÂ

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â PEG-
cholesteryl esterase  
HDL-cholesteryl esters ------------------------------------> HDL-unesterified
cholesterol + fatty acid

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â PEG-cholesterol oxidase  
Unesterified cholesterol + O2 \------------------------------------->
cholestenone + H2O2 Â

H2O2Â + 5-aminophenazone + N-ethyl-N-(3-methylphenyl)-Nâ_succinyl ethylene
diamine + H2O + H+ peroxidase ---> qunoneimine dye + H2O

Absorbance is measured at 600 nm.Â

**Analytical Note**

**Change in Assay Methods Most Likely Responsible for Changes in HDL
Cholesterol values in NHANES 1999-2008**  
  
Researchers are cautioned to interpret trends in HDL cholesterol for NHANES
1999-2008 in view of probable HDL cholesterol method effects. The mean HDL
cholesterol values from 1999-2008 showed changes for sample participants 20
years or older:

Mean HDL Cholesterol Values from 1999-2008 Years | n | Mean HDL(mg/dL)* | SEM**  
---|---|---|---  
1999-2000 | 4117 | 50.6 | 0.7  
2001-2002 | 4691 | 51.9 | 0.28  
2003-2004 | 4475 | 54.1 | 0.38  
2005-2006 | 4481 | 54.6 | 0.36  
2007-2008 | 5332 | 51.9 | 0.53  
  
  

* Weighted mean to account for complex sample design of NHANES   
**SEM is the standard error the mean

  

The changes in average HDL Cholesterol levels from 1999-2008 were seen across
various age, gender and race-ethnicity groups indicating a method effect. The
HDL cholesterol was analyzed in 1999-2002 using two methods - heparin
manganese precipitation and a direct HDL immunoassay depending on the
participant age and amount of specimen. Most participants in 1999-2002 were
measured by the precipitation method. Starting in 2003, all HDL cholesterol
samples were analyzed using the direct HDL cholesterol immunoassay method. The
heparin-manganese precipitation method and direct immunoassay method for
1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2005-2006 showed an undesirable bias (>4%) when
compared to the laboratory's HDL-cholesterol quality controls (Solomon Park
Research Laboratories, Kirkland, WA) that were assigned values established by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC HDL cholesterol
reference method uses heparin-manganese to precipitate HDL-cholesterol and the
Abell-Kendall method to measure cholesterol. The HDL cholesterol for
1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2005-2006 were adjusted using:

Corrected HDL =Â Â Â Â Â Â (Solomon Park assigned HDL value) x (Participant
HDL)Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Quality Control HDL
value associated with Participant sample)

The bias for the HDL cholesterol method for 2003-2004 was acceptable (<4%) and
the participant results were not corrected. In addition, there was a change in
instrumentation in 2005-2006 and there were several modifications of the
direct HDL cholesterol method. To control for these differences in methods and
instrumentation, the HDL cholesterol was corrected using the Solomon Lab
quality controls as described above. In 2007-2008, a new laboratory performed
the HDL cholesterol using a direct HDL cholesterol method similar to the
direct HDL method of 2005-2006, but it was performed on a different
instrument.  
  
Both laboratories performing HDL Cholesterol from 1999-2008 participated in
the CDC-NHLBI Lipid Standardization Program (LSP). The CDC LSP maximum
allowable bias for HDL Cholesterol is 5%. The average bias compared to the
reference CDC HDL Cholesterol value for 2007-2008 was approximately -0.5%. The
average bias compared to the CDC HDL Cholesterol values for 2003-2004 and
2005-2006 were approximately +2.7% and +2.0%, respectively. Unfortunately, the
HDL Cholesterol values for the LSP program for 1999-2002 could not be
evaluated. This indicates that the 2007-2008 HDL Cholesterol values may be
less biased than the 2003-2006 values; however, both laboratories were within
the 5% maximum allowable bias for HDL Cholesterol.  
  
The changes in average HDL Cholesterol levels from 1999-2008 were seen across
various age, gender and race-ethnicity groups indicating a method effect.
Other covariates (body mass index, medications, physical exercise, smoking and
alcohol consumption) may explain some of the changes in HDL cholesterol, but
it is unlikely to account for the majority of the mean changes in HDL
cholesterol.

**Triglycerides**

Triglycerides are measured enzymatically in serum or plasma using a series of
coupled reactions in which triglycerides are hydrolyzed to produce glycerol.
Glycerol is then oxidized using glycerol oxidase, and H2O2, one of the
reaction products, is converted via peroxidase to a phenazone. Absorbance is
measured at 500 nm. The reaction sequence is as follows:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â lipase  
Triglycerides + 3H2O ----------------------> glycerol + fatty acids

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
glycerokinase  
Glycerol + ATP -----------------------------------> glycerol-3-phosphate + ADP

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â glycerophosphate oxidase  
Glycerol-3-phosphate + O2--------------------------------> dihydroxyacetone
phosphate + H2O2

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â peroxidase  
H2O2 + 4-aminophenazone + 4-chlorophenol ----------------> 4-(p-benzoquinone-
monoimino)-phenazone + 2H2O + HCl

High levels of serum triglycerides help determine the risk for coronary heart
disease (CHD) and peripheral atherosclerosis. High triglycerides are
associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients
with other risk factors, such as low HDL-cholesterol, some patient groups with
elevated apolipoprotein-B, and patients with forms of low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol that may be particularly atherogenic. Desirable fasting
triglyceride levels are considered to be those below 150 mg/dL and are further
categorized as borderline high, 150â199 mg/dL; high, 200â499 mg/dL; and
very high, greater than or equal to 500 mg/dL. Very high triglycerides can
result in pancreatitis. Triglycerides are also measured because the value is
used to calculate LDL-cholesterol concentrations.Â Triglycerides are only
reported for the primary sample for fasting (at least 8 hours or more but less
than 24 hours) participants aged 16 and above who were examined in the morning
sessions.

**LDL-Cholesterol**

Most of the circulating cholesterol is found in three major lipoprotein
fractions: Very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), LDL, and HDL. LDL-cholesterol
is calculated from measured values of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and
HDL-cholesterol according to the Friedewald calculation:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â [LDL-cholesterol] = [total cholesterol] â [HDL-
cholesterol] â [triglycerides/5]

where [triglycerides/5] is an estimate of VLDL-cholesterol and all values are
expressed in mg/dL. The calculation is valid only for triglycerides less than
or equal to 400 mg/dL.

LDL carries most of the circulating cholesterol and, when elevated,
contributes to the development of coronary atherosclerosis. LDL-cholesterol is
measured to assess risk for CHD and to follow the progress of patients being
treated to lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Desirable levels of LDL-
cholesterol are below 130 mg/dL, borderline high is from 130â159 mg/dL, high
is 160â189 mg/dL and very high LDL-cholesterol is greater than or equal to
190 mg/dL.Â LDL-cholesterol is only reported for the primary sample for
fasting (at least 8 hours or more but less than 24 hours) participants aged 16
and above who were examined in the morning sessions.Â

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Johns HopkinsÂ
University Lipoprotein Analytical Laboratory. Detailed specimen collection and
processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
Description ofÂ Laboratory Methodology section.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

**LB2TC:**

The Laboratory 13 data file contains laboratory test results for Total
Cholesterol (LB2TC), which uses the reference analytic method. However, the
NHANES Laboratory 40 Biochemistry Profile also include measurements of Total
Cholesterol (LaboratoryÂ 40 variable name: LB2SCH). In general, for most
analyses, the appropriate variable to use is LB2TC.The value from the
biochemistry profile (LB2SCH) should not be used routinely.

**LB2TCSI:**

The Total Cholesterol in mg/dL (LB2TC) was converted to mmol/L (LB2TCSI) by
multiplying by 0.02586.

**LB2HDL:**

HDL-cholesterol was derived from two HDL-cholesterol methods. See Description
of Laboratory Methodology above.

**LB2HDLSI:**

The HDL-cholesterol in mg/dL (LB2HDL) was converted to mmol/L (LB2HDLSI) by
multiplying by 0.02586.

**LB2TR:** Â

Triglyceride levels for the primary sample, were measured on examinees who
were examined in the morning session only. The distribution of serum
triglycerides for the primary sample should be estimated only on examinees
ages 16 and above who fasted at least 8 hours or more but less than 24 hours,
were examined in the morning, and were randomly assigned to the morning
fasting sample.

The Laboratory 13AM Second Day Data File contains laboratory test results for
Triglycerides (LB2TR) derived from the reference analytic method. However, the
NHANES Lab 40 Biochemistry Profile also include measurements of triglycerides
(Lab 40 variable name is LB2STR).Â The appropriate variable to use is LB2TR
from Lab 13AM.

**LB2TRSI:**

The Triglycerides value in mg/dL (LB2TR) was converted to mmol/L (LBDTRSI) by
multiplying by 0.01129.

**LB2LDL:** Â

LDL-cholesterol levels for the primary sample were measured on examinees that
were examined in the morning session only. The distribution of serum LDL-
cholesterol for the primary sample should be estimated only on examinees ages
16 and above who fasted at least 8 hours or more but less than 24 hours, were
examined in the morning, and were randomly assigned to the morning fasting
sample.Â LDL-cholesterol is calculated from measured values of total
cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol according to the Friedewald
calculation:

[LDL-cholesterol] = [total cholesterol] â [HDL-cholesterol] â
[triglycerides/5]

where all values are expressed in mg/dL. The calculation is valid for
triglycerides less than or equal to 400 mg/dL.

**LB2LDLSI:**

The LDL-cholesterol value in mg/dL (LB2LDL) was converted to mmol/L (LB2LDLSI)
by multiplying by 0.02586.

**Special Notes for this Dataset**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
data files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during the household interviews. The Phlebotomy
Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of fasting, the
time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture.
The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Examination files may be linked to
the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.
