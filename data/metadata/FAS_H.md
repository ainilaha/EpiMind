### Fatty Acids - Serum (FAS_H)

####  Data File: FAS_H.xpt

##### First Published: March 2023

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The analysis of individual plasma or serum fatty acids is important in the
recognition of essential fatty acid deficiency (Siguel E. 1998) and in the
differential diagnosis of inborn errors of metabolism, such as mitochondrial
fatty acid oxidation disorders (Costa, et. al., 1998; Jones, et. al., 2000;
Moser, et. al., 1998). Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential
for normal development (Hamosh, et. al., 1998). The dietary content of
saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids influence the
concentration of cholesterol in low-density and high-density lipoproteins, and
consequently the development of atherosclerosis (O'Keefe, et. al., 1995).
Regular consumption of or supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids can have beneficial effects on long-term cardiovascular health due to
anti-inflammatory and possibly antiarrhythmic effects (Kang, et. al., 1996).
The goal of this method is to obtain US reference ranges for most circulating
fatty acids. Public health recommendations advise increasing or decreasing the
intake of various classes of fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated,
polyunsaturated) but relatively little fatty acid biomarker data exist to
support these recommendations and reference range data are scarce.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 11 and participants aged 12 and over who
were examined in the morning session were eligible.  

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Esterified fatty acids are hydrolyzed primarily from triglycerides,
phospholipids and cholesteryl esters using sequential treatment with mineral
acid and base in the presence of heat. Using a modification of (Lagerstedt,
et. al., 2001), total fatty acids are hexane-extracted from the matrix (100uL
serum or plasma) along with an internal standard solution containing eighteen
stable isotopically-labeled fatty acids to account for recovery. The extract
is derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr) in the presence of
triethylamine to form pentafluorobenzyl esters. The reaction mixture is
injected onto a capillary gas chromatograph column to resolve individual fatty
acids of interest from other matrix constituents. Fatty acids are detected
using electron capture negative-ion mass spectrometry within 34 minutes.
Eleven saturated, six monounsaturated, and thirteen polyunsaturated fatty
acids (thirty fatty acids in total) are measured using selected ion
monitoring. Quantitation is accomplished by comparing the peak area of the
analyte in the unknown with the peak area of a known amount in a calibrator
solution. Calculations are corrected based on the peak area of the internal
standard in the unknown compared with the peak area of the internal standard
in the calibrator solution.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Fatty Acids -
Serum](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/FAS-H-
MET-508.pdf) (March 2023)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they were
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al.,
1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA and QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et. al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2013-2014, approximately 82% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 96% of examined adults aged 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether the data are useable
without additional re-weighting for item non-response.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Ftutorials%2Findex.htm)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample weights**

The appropriate sample weights are provided in the variable WTFAS2YR in this
data file for all participants and should be used when analyzing these data.

Serum fatty acids were measured for all examined participants aged 3 to 11
years and a fasting subsample of participants 12 years and older. For
participants aged 3 to 11 years, their WTFAS2YR are equivalent to their MEC
exam sample weights. These participants have completed at least one physical
exam component in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample weight
larger than "0," regardless of their lab test results. For participants 12
years and older, special sample weights were created for the subsample. These
special weights accounted for the additional probability of selection into the
subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if participants 12 years and older were selected as part of the
fasting subsample but did not provide a blood specimen, they would have the
subsample weight value assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/FASTQX_H.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDCAPLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., LBXCAP) provides the analytic
result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., LBDCAPLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).  

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in µmol/L) for serum fatty acids:
