### Pregnancy Test - Urine (UC_C)

####  Data File: UC_C.xpt

#####  First Published: January 2006

#####  Last Revised: April 2006

## Component Description

The dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed on survey
participants 8 years and older. The scan involves radiation exposure to the
whole body. Pregnant women are excluded from the DXA, bioelectrical impedance,
and cardiovascular fitness components of the mobile examination center, so a
urine pregnancy test was performed first. If the urine test results were
positive for pregnancy, a serum pregnancy test was also performed.

## Eligible Sample

A pregnancy test was completed on female participants aged 12-59 years and
menstruating females aged 8-11 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The Icon 25 hCG test kit (Beckman Coulter) is a rapid chromatographic
immunoassay for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG) in urine or serum to aid in the early detection of pregnancy. The test
utilizes a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively
detect elevated levels of hCG in urine or serum.

A detailed description of the laboratory method used can be found on the
NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Urine and serum specimens were tested in the NHANES mobile examination
centers. Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are
discussed in the NHANES LPM.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found on
the NHANES website.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

A pregnancy test was completed on female participants aged 12-59 years and
menstruating females aged 8-11 years.
