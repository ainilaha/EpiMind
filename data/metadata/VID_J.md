# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2017-2018 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Vitamin D (VID_J)

####  Data File: VID_J.xpt

##### First Published: April 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are to provide data for monitoring secular
trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population and to
evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors, such as physical
activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's
nutritional status.  Also, to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and
public health policies, including welfare reform legislation, food
fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status
of the U.S. population.

These data will be used to estimate risks for deficiencies and toxicities of
specific nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population
reference data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and
other factors to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to
further define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease
prevention and health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 1 year and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The test principle for the CDC method utilizes high performance liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) for the quantitative
detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3), 3-epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3
(epi-25OHD3), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 (25OHD2) in human serum. The analytes
are chromatographically separated generally on one of three pentaflurophenyl
(PFP) columns. Mobile phase composition for optimized chromatography varies
slightly for the three columns but is between 69% and 72% methanol in water.
The composition of the solution added to the serum prior to extraction, the
solution used for reconstitution, and the needle wash should match that used
for the mobile phase.  

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

MET-508.pdf) (April 2022)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
(LPM). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they
are shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels are maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS periodically. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Four analytes are included in this dataset, total 25-Hydroxyvitamin D,
25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, and epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3.
Total 25-Hydroxyvitamin D is the sum of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and
25-hydroxyvitamin D3, but excludes epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3.

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/FASTQX_J.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
The SAS variable name ending in LC (ex., LBXVD2LC) indicates whether the
result was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result
was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was
below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXVIDMS)
provides the result for the analyte. For analytes with analytic results below
the lower limit of detection (ex., LBXVIDLC=1), an imputed fill value was
placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt (2)).

The lower limits of detection (LLOD in nmol/L) for Vitamin D metabolites are:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description****** |  **  LLOD******  
---|---|---  
LBXVD2MS |  25-hydroxyvitamin D2 |  2.05 nmol/L  
LBXVD3MS |  25-hydroxyvitamin D3 |  2.23 nmol/L  
LBXVE3MS |  epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D3 |  1.64 nmol/L  
  

**Analysis of 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Data from NHANES III (1988-1994) and NHANES
2001-2006, with NHANES data collected since 2007**

The LC-MS/MS-equivalent 25-Hydroxyvitamin D data are recommended for all
analyses, but especially for analyzing secular trends for serum vitamin D
involving NHANES III (1988-1994), NHANES 2001-2006 and NHANES data collected
since 2007. Users are strongly encouraged to review the [Analytical Note for
25-Hydroxyvitamin D Data Analysis
(cdc.gov)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/vitamind/analyticalnote.aspx?b=2009&e=2010&d=VID_F&x=XPT)
prior to the analysis.
