### Food Security (FSQ_F)

####  Data File: FSQ_F.xpt

##### First Published: March 2013

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Food Security section (variable name prefix FSQ) provides personal
interview data on the following four topics:

**1\. Household food security  
**In the household interview, an adult responded to the U.S. Food Security
Survey Module (US FSSM) questions (Bickel G, et al, 2000). There are 18 items
for households with children under the age of 18 years and 10 items for
households without children. Questions refer to all household members, not
just NHANES participants. Three categorical household-level variables were
created to characterize the overall food security status for the entire
household, the adults in the household, and the children in the household.
Responses to the 10 or 18 US FSSM items and the categorical data derived from
these responses are released on each household participant's record.

A question on household member's use of emergency foods from food banks, soup
kitchens, or other organizations in the last 12 month is also included in this
section.

**2\. Individual food security**  
Individual-level food security items were administered to all survey
participants in the households that affirmed any FSSM item during the
household interview. Adult (â‰¥ 16 years) and children (< 12 years) individual-
level food security questions were administered after the 24-hour dietary
recall in the Mobile Examination Center (MEC). Generally, adults responded for
themselves. An adult family member responded for a child, although the child
may have assisted. Adolescents (12-15 years) responded for themselves, in a
private room in the MEC, using an Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview
(ACASI) system.

Participants 16 years and older were asked 6 items about their own food
security. Participants under 16 years old were asked 5 items; the question
about having lost weight was not asked of this age group. Most NHANES survey
questions that assess a specific aspect of food security are identical or very
similar for adults, teens, and children.  
In 2009-2010, minor modifications were made to the data collection instruments
to further improve the clarity of the questions and to have the order of the
questions consistent across age groups.

Similar to the 2005-2006 and 2007-2008 cycles, data collected separately for
different age groups are combined and released as one variable for each topic;
however, the actual survey instruments may differ slightly by participant age.
The exact wording of the FSQ questionnaires used in the survey can be found at
the NHANES website at:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2009>.

These data are released only on the individual participant's record.

**3.**Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)/Food Stamp program
benefits****  
Except for the newly introduced term, SNAP, these questions were identical as
those in the 2007-2008 cycle. All SNAP/Food Stamp benefits questions were
collected at the household level. One adult responded to these questions for
the entire household during the household interview. Information collected
included whether anyone in the household had ever received SNAP/Food Stamp
benefits; whether anyone in the household received benefits in the last 12
months; time since last received benefits within last 12 months; and the
amount of benefits the household received last time.

These household-level data on SNAP/Food Stamp benefits are released on all
household participants' records.  

**4\. Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program benefits**  
Data collected for WIC benefits included one household-level question as well
as 7 individual-level questions for participants birth to 11 years old and 3
individual-level questions for women 12-59 years old.

In the household interview, an adult responded to the question on whether
anyone in the household received WIC benefits in the last 12 months. This
household-level question is released on all household participants' records.

For children participants' WIC benefits, information was collected on current
participation, participation in the last 12 month, and total length (in
months) of benefits received. Similar to previous cycles, current
participation and participation in the last 12 months were ascertained for
children birth to 5 years of age. Starting in 2007-2008, the target age group
for the benefit length question was extended from children birth to 5 years
old to birth to 11 years old. Additional information was also obtained on WIC
participation during various important periods in early childhood, including
prenatal, infancy, and 1-4 years old. These data were collected through adult
proxy during the household interview as part of the [Dietary Behavior and
Nutrition questionnaire
(DBQ)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/questionnaires/dbq_f.pdf)
and released on the individual participant's record.

For female participants 12 to 59 years old, information was collected on
current WIC participation, participation in the last 12 month, and total
length (in months) of benefits received. These questions were administered as
part of the [Reproductive Health questionnaire
(RHQ)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/questionnaires/mi_rhq_f.pdf)
during the interview in the MEC, using the Computer-Assisted Personal
Interviewing-CAPI (interviewer administered) system. Due to disclosure risks,
the WIC benefits data will only be released for women aged 20 years and above
in the present dataset. Data for women 12-19 years old will be available in
the Research Data Center (RDC) only. Please refer to the Analytic Notes
section for more details.

The table in Appendix 1 provides detailed information on each of the four FSQ
components described above. Appendix 2 highlights the changes in the FSQ
section among the latest four release cycles.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The automated interview systems used in NHANES are programmed with built-in
consistency checks to reduce data entry errors. Incoming FSQ data were
reviewed for accuracy and completeness. NHANES staff reviewed taped
interviews, traveled to field sites to observe interviews, read interviewer
comments, and attended training and re-training sessions to maintain the high
quality of data.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some
variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of
the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure
concerns.

**FSDHH, FSDAD, FSDCH (Household, adult, and child food security category)**  
Eighteen FSSM questions were asked of households with children under the age
of 18. Ten questions were asked of households without children. Three
categorical variables, each with four response levels, were created based on
the number of affirmative responses for those questions. These categorical
variables could be used to characterize the overall food security status for
the entire household, the adults in the household, and the children in the
household. The algorithms used to derive these categorical variables are
described below:

FSDHH (Household food security category):

Count affirmative responses in these 18 items: FSD032a, FSD032b, FSD032c,
FSD032d, FSD032e, FSD032f, FSD041, FSD052, FSD061, FSD071, FSD081, FSD092,
FSD102, FSD111, FSD122, FSD132, FSD141, and FSD146. Derive the codes as the
following:

1 = Household full food security: no affirmative response in any of these
items.  
2 = Household marginal food security: 1-2 affirmative responses.  
3 = Household low food security: 3-5 affirmative responses for household
without children under the age of 18; 3-7 affirmative responses for household
with children  
4 = Household very low food security: 6-10 affirmative responses for household
without children under the age of 18; 8-18 affirmative responses for household
with children

Households with children but provided no valid response to any of the
questions about children's food security were classified using the
specifications for households with no child.

FSDAD (Adult food security category):

Count affirmative responses in these 10 items: FSD032a, FSD032b, FSD032c,
FSD041, FSD052, FSD061, FSD071, FSD081, FSD092, and FSD102. Derive the codes
as the following:

1 = Adult full food security: no affirmative response in any of these items.  
2 = Adult marginal food security: 1-2 affirmative responses.  
3 = Adult low food security: 3-5 affirmative responses  
4 = Adult very low food security: 6-10 affirmative responses

For households without children under the age of 18, their household food
security category (FSDHH) should be identical to their adult food security
category (FSDAD).

FSDCH (Child food security category):

This category is only generated for households with children under the age of
18. Count affirmative responses in these 8 items: FSD032d, FSD032e, FSD032f,
FSD111, FSD122, FSD132, FSD141, and FSD146. Derive the codes as the following:

1 = Child full or marginal food security: no affirmative response in any of
these items.  
2 = Child marginal food security: 1 affirmative response.  
3 = Child low food security: 2-4 affirmative responses.  
4 = Child very low food security: 5-8 affirmative responses.

Definition of FSSM affirmative response

Affirmative response for FSSM questions are defined as:

  * Answered "often true" or "sometimes true" (i.e., codes 1 or 2) for items FSD032a, FSD032b, FSD032c, FSD032d, FSD032e, or FSD032f. 
  * Answered "yes" (i.e., code 1) for items FSD041, FSD061, FSD071, FSD081, FSD092, FSD111, FSD122, FSD141, or FSD146. 
  * Answered "almost every month", or "some months but not every month" (i.e., codes 1 or 2) for items FSD052, FSD102, or FSD132. 

No food security categories are assigned if all or most of these items were
answered as "don't know" or "refusal." There are 53 such records in the
2009-2010 dataset, 26 of them from households with children. These records
contain missing values for FSDHH, FSDAD, and FSDCH.

**FSD401, FSD411, FSD421, FSD431, FSD440, and FSD451 (Individual food security
items)  
**In previous cycles, each of the individual food security items was collected
using a single question. For example, item FSD401 was collected by the
question "In the last 30 days, did you cut the size of your meals because
there wasn't enough money for food?" Although the question was worded to
obtain a "yes/no" answer, the requested response categories were "often,"
"sometimes," "never," "refused," or "don't know". Therefore, interviewers
often had to further probe for the corresponding responses. In 2009-2010,
changes were made to collect these items using two-part questions among adults
(â‰¥ 16 years) and children (< 12 years). The respondent was first asked to
answer "yes" or "no" to the original question. If the respondent answered
"yes," a follow-up question "Did that happen often, sometimes or just once or
twice?" was asked to ascertain the frequency. No changes were made to the
instrument used for adolescents (12-15 years) because the full question,
including all response categories was displayed on the self-administered
computer screen to the adolescent participants.  
  
For items FSD401, FSD411, FSD421, FSD431, and FSD440, the responses of
"sometimes" and "once or twice" were collapsed into the category "sometimes"
in the released variable.

For FSD451, responses other than "Never" were very rare; therefore, responses
of "often" and "sometimes" were collapsed into one category "ever" in the
released variable.

**FSD225 (Time since last received SNAP/Food Stamp benefits)**  
During the household interview, the respondent was asked to report the date
that the household last received SNAP/Food Stamp benefits. A variable was then
derived by calculating the number of days between the time the household last
received the SNAP/Food Stamp benefit and the date of interview and released as
FSD225.

When the respondent refused to answer the question or did not know the exact
date, a follow-up question (FSQ230) was asked to see whether any members of
the household currently receive SNAP/Food Stamp benefits. For these
households, the answer to FSQ230 was used to derive the codes 55555 (current
HH FS benefits recipient, last received date unknown) and 66666 (non-current
HH FS benefits recipient, last received date unknown) for variable FSD225.

**FSD670ZC, FSD670ZW (Number of months the participant received WIC benefit)  
**This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to
allow respondents to report the length in either month or year. The released
variables were edited to standardize the reported length to number of months.

A few responses to this item appeared unlikely (e.g., a mother or a child
receiving WIC for longer than WIC regulations stipulate). Some of them may
have plausible explanations for longer WIC intake (such as a mother with
consecutive births/pregnancies) while others may result from recall bias. Data
users need to be cautious when analyzing this information.

**FSD650ZW (Women received WIC benefit in last 12 month)  
**Similar to previous data collection cycles, this question only asked of
female participants who were pregnant at the time of interview or who had
given birth in the two years period prior to the interview.

**FSD660ZW (Women currently received WIC benefit)  
**This question only asked of female participants who received WIC benefits in
the last 12 months, and were pregnant or 0-12 months postpartum at the time of
interview. The postpartum screening criterion for this question is a new
addition started in 2007-2008. It helps to better classify eligibility for WIC
benefit.

## Analytic Notes

NHANES has assessed household food security with the U.S. Food Security Survey
Module (US FSSM) since 1999. Individual-level food security items for adults
and children were implemented in the survey in 2000, and added for adolescents
in 2005. Similar modules have been used in various surveys, including the
Census Bureau's Current Population Survey (CPS) and a growing number of State,
local, and regional studies, such as the California Health Interview Survey
(CHIS). For more information on food security measurement, please refer to the
USDA's website at: <http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-
assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement.aspx>.

The NHANES household interview included two questionnaires: a sample
participant questionnaire to collect information regarding each individual
survey participant's personal health status, and a family questionnaire to
collect information at the family level, such as total income for the family,
food availability in the family, etc. The sample participant questionnaire was
answered by participants themselves (adult proxy for child under 16 years
old). The family questionnaire required an adult family member, preferably the
head of the family, to respond to these questions for the entire family. The
information on household food security status and SNAP/Food Stamp program
benefits in the FSQ section were collected as part of this family
questionnaire. In 2009-2010, 67 participants had missing values to all of
these items in the FSQ section because the family questionnaire was not
administered. Most common reasons for missing the family questionnaire
interview were: "no eligible adult respondent in the family available" or
"refusal."

The eligibility of the individual food security questions was determined by
the reported household food security status. The abovementioned 67
participants who did not have food security data reported for their household
were not eligible for the individual food security questions collected in the
MEC. In this dataset, there were 285 participants who were eligible to the
individual food security questions but did not have data in these items. Of
them, 243 did not come to the MEC exam or missed the interview when they were
in the exam center due to various reasons (such as arrived late/left early,
refusal, illness, emergency, or equipment failure). Forty-two participants
missed the individual food security questions because their family
questionnaire data were collected or uploaded to the system after their
examinations in the MEC.

In 2007-2008, a new sample design was implemented into the survey. All
Hispanics were oversampled, not just Mexican-Americans. In addition, for each
of the race/ethnicity domains, the age domains 12-15 and 16-19 were combined
and the age minority domains 40-59 were split into 10-year age domains 40-49
and 50-59. This has led to an increase in the number of participants aged 40+
and a decrease in participants aged 12-19 from previous cycles. Lastly,
pregnant women were no longer oversampled. Based on these changes, unweighted
frequencies of certain variables may differ slightly in this survey cycle
compared to survey cycles prior to 2007-2008. For further discussion, please
see the Analytic Notes for the Demographic data file:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/demo_f.htm>.

WIC benefit information was collected for female participants aged 12-59 years
in 2009-2010. Due to potential disclosure risks, this file does not include
data of WIC benefit related variables for females less than 20 years old. For
female participants 12-19 years old, records are coded as missing for the
following variables: FSD650ZW, FSD660ZW, and FSD670ZW. Please note that these
exclusions were not made to the FSQ data files released prior to the 2007-2008
cycle. Analysts wishing to combine data for multiple years should pay careful
attention to these changes. The complete data file containing all variables
for females 12 years and older (FSQ_F_R) is available through the NCHS
Research Data Center.

FSQ data were collected in the household and in the MEC. For data items
collected in the household interview, the interview sample weights may be used
in their analysis. However, if the data analysis requires merging of data
collected in the household with data collected in the MEC, examination sample
weights should be used for analyses. The recommended weights for each
individual component in the FSQ section are listed in the table in Appendix 1.
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/nhanes/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. Both
of these are available on the NHANES website.
