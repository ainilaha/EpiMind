## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. Infection with hepatitis E virus (HEV) has been responsible
for large water-borne epidemics of acute disease in developing countries and
for acute sporadic disease in industrialized developed countries. In
immunocompromised individuals, infection with HEV may also cause chronic
infection, which may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Because of the high
rate of asymptomatic infection with these viruses, information about the
prevalence of these diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By
testing a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES
provides the most reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to
evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In
addition, NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other
hepatitis viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis
viruses is used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age
and racial/ethnic groups and will provide a national picture of the
epidemiologic determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years or older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis E IgG Antibody (IgG Anti-HEV)**

The abia HEV IgG is an enzyme immunoassay kit intended for the detection of
IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus in human serum or plasma. During an
initial incubation, HEV antibody in the sample binds with HEV antigen coated
onto wells of a polystyrene stripped plate. Unbound sample is removed by
washing. During a second incubation, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody
conjugate (monoclonal mouse antibodies against human IgG) binds to any human
IgG from the sample that was captured on the well. Unbound conjugate is
removed by washing and a substrate solution containing tetramethylbenzidine is
added to produce color. The reaction is stopped by adding a sulphuric acid
solution and the optical density (OD) of each well is read. The presence or
absence of IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus is determined by the ratio of
the OD of each sample to the calculated cut-off value. A sample is considered
negative if the sample OD value is < cut-off and is considered positive if the
sample OD value is ≥ cut-off.

**Hepatitis E IgM Antibody (IgM Anti-HEV)**

The abia HEV IgM is an enzyme immunoassay kit intended for the detection of
IgM antibodies to hepatitis E virus in human serum or plasma. During an
initial incubation, HEV antibody in the sample binds with HEV antigen coated
onto wells of a polystyrene stripped plate. Unbound sample is removed by
washing. During a second incubation, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody
conjugate (monoclonal mouse antibodies against human IgM) binds to any human
IgM from the sample that was captured on the well. Unbound conjugate is
removed by washing and a substrate solution containing tetramethylbenzidine is
added to produce color. The reaction is stopped by adding a sulphuric acid
solution and the OD of each well is read. The presence or absence of IgM
antibodies to hepatitis E virus is determined by the ratio of the OD of each
sample to the calculated cut-off value. A sample is considered negative if the
sample OD value is < cut-off and is considered positive if the sample OD value
is ≥ cut-off.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [2017-2018
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) Laboratory Procedures Manuals (LPMs).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they were
shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral
Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
Laboratory Data Overview documents for general information on NHANES
laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in the 2017-March 2020 approximately
76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [ NHANES 2017-March 2020
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

This data is qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.
