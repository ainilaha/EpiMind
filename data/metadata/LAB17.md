## Component Description

**1.1 Cryptosporidium**

Cryptosporidium is an important cause of outbreaks of waterborne disease in
the United States. In 1993, two outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis occurred in
large metropolitan areas (Milwaukee and Las Vegas/Clark County) and were
associated with deaths among immuno-compromised persons. While these
waterborne outbreaks are increasingly being recognized, it is unclear how much
endemic waterborne cryptosporidiosis occurs due to low-level contamination of
drinking water. To provide an estimate of exposure to this organism, the
prevalence of antibodies to cryptosporidium will be measured in NHANES
participants aged 6-49 years. This estimate will support a CDC/EPA response to
a Congressional mandate to evaluate the burden of waterborne disease in the
United States.

According to a 1999 CDC report, toxoplasmosis is the third leading cause of
death due to food borne infections and leads to an estimated 400 to 6,000
cases of congenital infection in the United States. The accuracy of these
estimates, however, is unknown. Evidence from Europe suggests that the
incidence of toxoplasmosis has dropped substantially in the last decade; data
from the U.S. is less clear cut but also suggests a decline. Serologic tests
are available to determine who has become infected with toxoplasmosis.
Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies are detectable 1-3 weeks after infection
and remain detectable for the life of the individual. Toxoplasma-specific IgM
antibodies are also detectable 1-3 weeks after infection but generally decline
to nil by one year after infection. The presence of both IgG and IgM is
evidence for infection within the last year. The presence of IgG antibody
without IgM is considered indicative of past infection. Serum tests for both
IgG and IgM antibody to toxoplasmosis will be added to the NHANES 2001
laboratory protocol to obtain the most accurate information available about
the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in the U.S. and determine if the rates are
changing over time. Toxoplasma IgG antibody was measured in NHANES III with an
overall prevalence of 22.5%.

**1.2 Laboratory**

Blood and urine specimens are collected on participants aged one year and
older at the mobile examination centers (MECs). Hematological profiles are
completed for all participants, and specified laboratory tests are performed
upon each specimen based on the participant's age at time of interview and
sex.Â

The laboratory component of NHANES includes the collection, processing,
storage, and shipping of blood, urine, and other biological and environmental
specimens. The blood collection procedure consists of administering a
questionnaire to screen for conditions that excludes the participants from the
blood draw and determines fasting status, a blood draw, and collecting
specimens for special studies. The urine collection procedure consists of
urine collection, urine processing, and pregnancy testing. The CoulterÂ® MAXM
performs a complete blood count on blood specimens to provide a study of blood
cells and coagulation for all participants.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 to 49 years who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria  
  
**Exclusion Criteria**

  * Hemophiliacs 
  * Participants who received chemotherapy within last 4 weeks 
  * The presence of the following on both arms: rashes, gauze dressings, casts, edema, paralysis, tubes, open sores or wounds, withered arms or limbs missing, damaged, sclerosed or occluded veins, allergies to cleansing reagents, burned or scarred tissue, shunt or IV. 

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Data Collection Methods**

The MEC phlebotomist draws blood from the participant's arm. In the laboratory
the blood is processed, stored and shipped to the Division of Parasitic
Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention for analysis.

**Examination Protocol**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials were
stored under appropriate frozen (-20 degrees Centigrade) conditions until they
were shipped to Division of Parasitic Diseases, National Center for Infectious
Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for testing. The
analytical methods are described in the Analytic methodology section.

**Survey Staff**

The NHANES 1999-2000 laboratory staff consists of medical technologists and
phlebotomists. The medical technologists hold baccalaureates in medical
technology. The American Society for Clinical Pathologists or a similar
organization certifies the medical technologists and the phlebotomists. All
laboratory staff completes comprehensive training in standardized laboratory
procedures before they begin working in the MEC. The MEC phlebotomists
complete comprehensive training in pediatric phlebotomy techniques, including
instruction by a pediatric nurse practitioner.

**Data Collection Forms**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Each chapter
in the LPM specifies the procedure to be used for preparation of the
participant, specimen collection, labeling, processing, and preservation, and
conditions for specimen transport that are appropriate for that method.  
  
**Analytic Methodology**

**Cryptosporidium**

**Recombinant protein expression**  
The following two deoxyoligonucleotides were designed for the directional
cloning of the C. parvum 27-kDa antigen (GenBank accession number U34390) into
the BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites of the pGEX 4T-2 expression
vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden): Cp23 5'-primer (5'-CGC GGA TCC
ATG GGT TGT TCA TCA TCA AAG-3') and Cp23 3'-primer (5'-GCG GAA TTC ATT AGG CAT
CAG CTG GCT TG-3'). The 27-kDa antigen coding sequence was amplified from 260
ng of genomic DNA by using 100 μM concentrations of Cp23-5' and Cp23-3' and
AmpliTaq DNA polymerase as directed by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus,
Norwalk, Conn.). The following amplification protocol was used: 30 cycles of
94oC for 1 min, 55oC for 2 min, and 72oC for 3 min followed by 1 cycle of 72oC
for 15 min. Plasmid containing insert was transformed into Escherichia coli
strain HB101 cells (Life Technologies, Frederick, Md.). The sequence of the
resulting clone was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. A recombinant C.
parvum 27-kDa antigen/Schistosoma japonicum glutathione-S-transferase (GST)
fusion protein was purified from isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
induced cell cultures using glutathione Sepharose 4B as directed by the
manufacturer (GST Bulk Purification Module, Pharmacia Biotech). The C. parvum
protein with an additional GlySer dipeptide at the amino terminus was released
by overnight cleavage with thrombin at room temperature and then separated
from uncleaved fusion protein and the GST cleavage product by passage over
glutathione Sepharose 4B resin. Protein purity was monitored by both SDS
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with a monoclonal
antibody against the native 27-kDa antigen (C6B6) and with serum samples from
infected humans.  
  
**Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay**  
Antigens diluted in 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.6) were used to sensitize
96-well plates overnight at 4oC (Immulon 2 flat-bottom microtiter immunoassay
plates, Dynatech Industries, Inc., McLean, Va.). Each well contained 50 μl of
either the recombinant 27-kDa antigen (0.2μg/ml) (BCA protein microassay,
Pierce Biotech Company, Rockford, Ill.). The plates were washed in 0.05%
Tween-20 PBS and blocked with 0.3% Tween-20 PBS for 1 hour at 4oC. After a
series of three washes (subsequent washes were all with 0.05% Tween-20 PBS),
50 μl aliquots of serum diluted 1:50 with wash buffer were added to each well.
All serum samples were tested in duplicate. A two-fold serial dilution (1:50
to 1:6400) of a strong positive control was used to generate a standard curve
on each individual plate. Two buffer blanks, three confirmed positive sera,
and a battery of four serum samples known by Western blot assay to be negative
for C. parvum antibodies were also included on each plate. Plates were
incubated 2 hours at room temperature and then washed four times with wash
buffer. A biotinylated mouse monoclonal antibody against human IgG (clone
HP6017, Zymed Laboratories, 50 μl of a 1:1000 dilution in wash buffer) was
added to each well and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. Following
four washes, the wells were filled with alkaline phosphatase-labeled
streptavidin (Life Technologies, 50 μl of a 1:500 dilution in wash buffer) and
incubated an additional hour at room temperature. After four washes (the final
wash for 10 minutes at room temperature), p-nitrophenylphosphate substrate was
added in 3 mM MgCl2 and 10% diethanolamine at pH 10, and the color was allowed
to develop until the 1:50 positive control wells had reached an absorbance of
about 1.5 at 405 nm. Absorbances were measured using a Molecular Devices UVmax
kinetic microplate reader. Antibody levels of the unknown samples were
assigned a unit value based on the 8-point positive control standard curve
with a four parameter curve fit. The 1:50 dilution of the positive control was
arbitrarily assigned a value of 6400 units. Unknown samples with absorbance
values above the standard curve were diluted further and reassayed. Arbitrary
unit values were expressed per microliter of serum.



## Data Processing and Editing

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES
1999-2000. In the mobile examination centers (MECs) and analytical
laboratories, data for the laboratory component is recorded directly onto a
computerized data collection form. The system is centrally integrated and it
allows for ongoing monitoring of much of the data. While the complete blood
count and pregnancy analyses are performed in the MEC laboratory, most
analyses are conducted elsewhere by approximately 21 laboratories across the
United States.

Guidelines are developed that provided standards for naming variables, filling
missing values, and handling missing records. NCHS staff, assisted by contract
staff, develops data editing specifications that check data sets for valid
codes, ranges, and skip pattern consistencies and examine the consistency of
values between interrelated variables. Comments are reviewed and recoded. NCHS
staff verifies extremely high and low values whenever possible, and numerous
consistency checks are performed. Nonetheless, users should examine the range
and frequency of values before analyzing data.

For laboratory tests with a lower detection limit, results below the lower
detection limit are replaced with a value equal to the detection limit divided
by the square root of two. This value is created to help the user distinguish
a nondetectable laboratory test result from a measured laboratory test result.

The data editing specifications are as follows:

  * Age and gender checks 
  * Total number of observations complete for each field
  * No field overlap, truncated values, or weird results
  * Direct data entry (DDE) errors
  * Abnormal results confirmed by lab 
  * Test algorithm performed 
  * Checked comment codes to resolve missing results and missing records 
  * All missing results and missing MEC-examined records are accounted 
  * Duplicate records are verified and deleted 
  * Apply the SI conversion 
  * Apply the below detection limit formula. 



## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

**MEC**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation, and testing
procedures. Constructive feedback is given to each staff. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels are
maintained.

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols meet the 1988
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control and
quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

**Analytical laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC these methods include performing
second examinations on previously examined participants and blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0 percent of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the Contract
laboratories outlining the Westgaard rules used when running NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in
the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of
concern. NCHS and Westat are currently reviewing these reports.

**Special Notes on Using the Dataset**

The analysis of NHANES 1999-2000 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 1999-2000
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and
phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.
