### Audiometry (AUX_J)

####  Data File: AUX_J.xpt

##### First Published: November 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES 2017-2018 audiometry examination component (variable name prefix
AUX) consists of four parts:

1) Pre-exam audiometric question - a series of questions to identify
conditions that would affect how audiometric testing is conducted, or how
results are interpreted. Questions include whether the participant has ear
tubes, a current cold or ear problem, recent loud noise exposure, and listened
to music with earphones in the past 24 hours. NOTE: more extensive data
relating to a survey participant's hearing status and history of noise
exposure are contained in the audiometry questionnaire (AUQ) section of the
NHANES Sample Person Questionnaire.

2) Otoscopy - a brief otoscopic screening (physical) exam of the ear canals
and eardrums to identify abnormalities, which would require alternate
audiometric procedures or influence interpretation of test results, and to
identify conditions which might require medical referral. The exam screened
for excessive or impacted ear cerumen (wax), physical abnormalities, or
collapsing external ear canals.

3) Middle ear testing - a measurement of eardrum compliance by placing a probe
with a rubber tip into the entrance of the ear canal. It is used to identify
middle ear pathologies that might contribute to a hearing loss. There are
three middle ear tests: tympanometry, wideband reflectance, and acoustic
reflex. The AUX_J data file consists of tympanometric quantitative measurement
variables for middle ear volume, pressure, compliance, and gradient. It also
includes tympanogram quality ratings and scores variables. The raw data for
the participant's tympanometric curves (AUXTYM_J), wideband reflectance curves
(AUXWBR_J), and acoustic reflex curves (AUXAR_J) are released separately.

4) Pure tone air conduction audiometry - a measurement of hearing sensitivity
by presenting pure tone signals to the ear through earphones and by varying
the intensity of the signals until a participant's hearing threshold at that
frequency is determined. Testing is performed at frequencies across the range
of human hearing.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 6-19 years and 70 years and older were eligible. There
were no precluding conditions for any part of the audiologic exam. However,
participants using hearing aids who were not able to remove them for testing
and participants who had sufficient ear pain at the time of the exam that they
could not tolerate headphones were excluded.

## Protocol and Procedure

All audiometry exam sections were performed by trained examiners on
participants in a dedicated sound-isolating room in the Mobile Examination
Center (MEC). Hearing threshold testing was conducted on both ears of
participants at seven frequencies. Children aged 6-11 years were tested in the
following frequency order so that data may be obtained for more important
frequencies first in case the child's attention wanes before all frequencies
can be completed: Ear 1: 1000, 2000, 1000 (repeat), 4000, 8000 Hz. Ear 2:
1000, 2000, 1000 (repeat), 4000, 8000, 6000, 3000, 500 Hz. Ear 1: 6000, 3000,
500 Hz. Adolescents aged 12-19 years and adults aged 70 years and older were
tested in the frequency order 1000, 500, 1000 (repeat), 2000, 3000, 4000,
6000, 8000 Hz for ear 1 and then for ear 2. The ear tested first was varied to
prevent biasing the data. However, if the participant indicated one ear
hearing better than the other, the ear with better sensitivity was tested
first. Testing was conducted according to a modified Hughson Westlake
procedure using the automated testing mode of the audiometer. The approximate
audiometer output constraints for standard and insert earphones was 100
decibels (dB) at 500 to 6000 Hz and 90 dB at 8000 Hz. Some earphones might
produce slightly higher output than others. A threshold greater than 90 dB can
be obtained using a manual testing mode. Observed values, therefore, varied
between -10 and 110 dB. If a participant did not respond to the signal tone at
any level for one or more frequencies because of deafness or severe hearing
loss, a code value of 666 was entered. Manual testing was conducted on
children aged 6-8 years. Manual testing was also conducted when the
participant could not operate the response switch or responded too slowly for
the audiometer to accurately record the response.

In some instances, if a pure tone audiometric signal is sufficiently loud, it
can "crossover" and be heard by the opposite ear via bone conduction. When
this occurs, it is difficult to determine if the threshold obtained is truly
the threshold of the test ear, or an artifact of the non-test ear (which may
have better hearing). For the NHANES hearing threshold testing, a crossover
retesting protocol was performed whenever the observed threshold at any given
frequency was poorer in one ear than the other by 25 dB at 500 and 1000 Hz or
40 dB at any higher frequency. Retesting was accomplished using insert
earphones, which are smaller and have less direct contact with the bones of
the head. Thus, a much louder stimulus is required before crossover occurs.
Due to the complexity of the procedure, masking was not employed in the NHANES
audiometry exam.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Instrumentation for the audiometry component included an Audiometric Research
Tool (ART) system with standard TDH-49P headphones and Etymotic EarTone 3A
insert earphones. Interacoustics Titan (middle ear analyzer) was used to
conduct middle ear testing. Daily monitoring ambient noise levels was
accomplished with a Quest Model BA-202-27 Bioacoustic Simulator. AUX data were
entered directly into the computerized NHANES database system. Data from the
ART system and Interacoustics Titan were captured electronically and uploaded
into the survey information system automatically.

Beginning in the 2017-2018, the ART system was used to conduct the pure-tone
air conduction hearing test on survey participants. The ART system is a
comprehensive, high configurable audiometer designed for the research
application. The ART system consists of a dedicated National Instruments
hardware and ART software as an audiometer. The ART software has been
programmed to conduct the threshold test automatically and can also be used to
conduct the threshold test manually. The ART system also contains an
integrated calibration system, called Trident, to measure the sound levels put
out by the system. A G.R.A.S. calibration kit with couplers for each type of
earphones is used in conjunction with the ART to monitor calibration. The ART
calibrations include the Trident software itself check, the background noise
measurement, an acoustic calibration check (to measure the output, distortion,
and linearity of the audiometer through both standard and insert earphones),
and a listening check (tone quality, attenuator accuracy, headphone cords,
crossover, etc.). The ART calibration checks were conducted at the beginning
of each survey location, daily throughout the entire exam, and at the end of
each survey location to ensure that the accuracy has not shifted. In addition
to these calibration checks, each ART system received an exhaustive
calibration once a year or whenever unresolvable problems were discovered
during the calibration checks. The calibration must be accomplished by the
manufacturer or a certified laboratory to ensure that the calibrations are
traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

An Interacoustics Titan was used to conduct middle ear testing. The physical
volume was checked on the Titan to ensure that it was within the calibration
limits. In addition, the MEC Health Technicians ran a sample test on one ear
to ensure that the unit is producing clear, normal graphs for the tympanogram
and wideband reflectance. The Titan calibration checks were conducted at the
beginning of each survey location, daily throughout the entire exam, and at
the end each survey location. The Titan also received an exhaustive NIST-
traceable calibration check annually.

A Bioacoustic Simulator was used to continuously measure the background noise
levels in the audiometric test room during the exam. Pure tone audiometric
testing was not performed if ambient noise levels in the test booth exceeded
maximum permissible levels. The microphones and sound measurement function of
the bioacoustic simulator were checked by a certified laboratory annually or
whenever unsolvable problems were discovered.

As an additional quality measure, all audiograms, whether conducted in
automated or manual mode, tested the 1000 Hz frequency twice in each ear as a
measure of the reliability of the participant's responses. Pure tone
audiograms were not accepted if there was more than a 10 dB difference between
them. For further details regarding any of these procedures, analysts should
consult the [NHANES 2017-2018 Audiometry Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2018-Audiometry-
Procedures-Manual-508.pdf).

The MEC health technicians who performed the audiometry examination component
of NHANES were professionally trained by a certified audiologist from the
National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH). NIOSH also
monitored the performance of each health technician on a regular basis. Field
visits to each MEC were conducted by the NIOSH audiologist at least three
times per year. Additionally, NCHS project officers visited the MECs
approximately twice per year to observe the audiometry examinations and verify
that standard testing procedures were being followed. NIOSH consultants
provided the MEC health technicians with annual retraining and protocol
updates.

The quantitative tympanometry measurements reported in this data file
represent the single best of each of the two curves obtained during middle ear
testing. Subjective quality ratings for these tympanograms are the variables
AUAREQC and AUALEQC. These represent a qualitative assessment of each
tympanogram by the consulting audiologist. The consulting audiologist also
scored these tympanograms using a common classification system developed by
Liden (1969) and modified by Jerger (1970). Two variables AUATYMTR and
AUATYMTL provide information about what the tympanometry results mean in terms
of the participant's middle ear status.

## Data Processing and Editing

The wording of some questions asked before the audiometry exam has been
simplified for children aged 6-11 years. Therefore, there are two separated
sets of variables for the pre-exam audiometric questionnaire: one for children
aged 6-11 years and another for adolescents aged 12-19 years and adults aged
70 years and older.

All data were captured in the NHANES computerized database system, with
audiometric and middle ear analyzer data automatically uploaded. On a
continuous basis, a consulting audiologist performed a clinical review of all
data for each participant as it was received, checking for quality and
consistency. In addition, a computerized data editing program was developed to
check for logical inconsistencies in the data and technician errors, and to
cross-check other issues affecting data quality (consistency in identifying
potential instances where crossover effects might have occurred, assurance of
randomization of the initial test ear, etc.). Back-end edits of the data were
performed as needed when errors were detected.

## Analytic Notes

This examination was administered to a full sample of participants in the MEC.
Therefore, the NHANES MEC examination weights should be used for data
analysis. For more information on the use of sample weights in current NHANES
data analysis and for combining data across multiple NHANES survey years,
please refer to the [NHANES Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the online
[NHANES Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

Audiologic data analysis is a complex procedure and requires a thorough
knowledge of the specialty content area for valid results to be obtained. If
an analyst does not have professional experience in this area, it is
recommended that audiologic consultation be obtained to help formulate and
review the results of the analysis. Data analysts should be especially aware
of the fact that the number "666" in all primary audiometric frequency data
fields (AUXU1K1R through AUXU8KL) as well as in all repeat test frequencies
(AUXR1K1R through AUXR8KL) is a qualitative code for nonresponse at a
particular frequency and does not represent actual measured decibel hearing
threshold values. These nonresponse values should be appropriately edited
prior to any numerical data analysis.
