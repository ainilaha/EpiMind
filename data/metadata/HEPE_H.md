### Hepatitis E: IgG & IgM Antibodies (HEPE_H)

####  Data File: HEPE_H.xpt

## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the
United States. Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and
control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Infection with hepatitis E virus
(HEV) has been responsible for large water-borne epidemics of acute disease in
developing countries and for acute sporadic disease in industrialized
developed countries. In immunocompromised individuals, infection with HEV may
also cause chronic infection, which may progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Because of the high rate of asymptomatic infection with these viruses,
information about the prevalence of these diseases is needed to monitor
prevention efforts. By testing a nationally representative sample of the U.S.
population, NHANES will provide the most reliable estimates of age-specific
prevalence needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies to prevent
these infections. In addition, NHANES provides the means to better define the
epidemiology of other hepatitis viruses. NHANES testing for markers of
infection with hepatitis viruses will be used to determine secular trends in
infection rates across most age and racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a
national picture of the epidemiologic determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

Survey participants aged 6 years or older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis E IgG Antibody (IgG Anti-HEV)**

DS-EIA-ANTI-HEV-G is an enzyme immunoassay kit intended for the detection of
IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus in human serum or plasma. During an
initial incubation, HEV antibody in the sample binds with HEV antigen coated
onto wells of a polystyrene stripped plate. Unbound sample is removed by
washing. During a second incubation, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody
conjugate (monoclonal mouse antibodies against human IgG) binds to any human
IgG from the sample that was captured on the well. Unbound conjugate is
removed by washing and a substrate solution containing tetramethylbenzidine is
added to produce color. The reaction is stopped by adding a sulphuric acid
solution and the OD of each well is read. The presence or absence of IgG
antibodies to hepatitis E virus is determined by the ratio of the OD of each
sample to the calculated cut-off value. A sample is considered negative if the
sample OD value is < cut-off and is considered positive if the sample OD value
is ≥ cut-off.

**Hepatitis E IgM Antibody (IgM Anti-HEV)**

DS-EIA-ANTI-HEV-M is an enzyme immunoassay kit intended for the detection of
IgM antibodies to hepatitis E virus in human serum or plasma. During an
initial incubation, HEV antibody in the sample binds with HEV antigen coated
onto wells of a polystyrene stripped plate. Unbound sample is removed by
washing. During a second incubation, horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody
conjugate (monoclonal mouse antibodies against human IgM) binds to any human
IgM from the sample that was captured on the well. Unbound conjugate is
removed by washing and a substrate solution containing tetramethylbenzidine is
added to produce color. The reaction is stopped by adding a sulphuric acid
solution and the OD of each well is read. The presence or absence of IgM
antibodies to hepatitis E virus is determined by the ratio of the OD of each
sample to the calculated cut-off value. A sample is considered negative if the
sample OD value is < cut-off and is considered positive if the sample OD value
is ≥ cut-off.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to laboratory methods, lab equipment, or lab site for
anti-HEV testing.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Blood specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate refrigerated (5°C) conditions until they
are shipped to University of Missouri for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the University of Missouri's quality control and
quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013 - 2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/fastqx_h.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The age ranges and constraints for hepatitis E testing are as follows: The IgM
and IgG hepatitis E antibody tests are performed on all participants 6 years
or older.  
  
**Detection Limits**

Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower limits of
detection (LLODs) isn't applicable.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
