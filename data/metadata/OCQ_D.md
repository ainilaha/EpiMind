### Occupation (OCQ_D)

####  Data File: OCQ_D.xpt

##### First Published: December 2011

##### Last Revised: April 2013

## Component Description

The Occupation Questionnaire Section (prefix OCQ; questions OCD150 to OCD395)
contains personal interview data on employment and variables relating to the
work environment.

OCQ Section Topics:

  * Data for Sample Person's Current Job (OCD231-OCD270): weekly hours worked, public vs. private sector, industry and occupation group codes, duration of employment, and workshift data (usual work schedule). 
  * Exposure to Workplace Tobacco Smoke at the Current Job (OCQ290G/OCQ290Q) 
  * Data for the Sample Person's Longest Job (OCD390G-OCD 395): occupation group codes, duration of employment. 

## Eligible Sample

In the 2005-2006 survey, the OCQ Questionnaire was administered to survey
participants 16+ years of age.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. Persons 16 years of age
and older and emancipated minors were interviewed directly.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. During the 2005-2006 data
collection cycle, periodic QC checks were performed on the Occupation
questionnaire data being collected and interviewer specific feedback and
retraining was performed as appropriate.

## Data Processing and Editing

A subject's questionnaire interview responses were entered into a pentop
computer and then uploaded into a computerized database in the same manner as
other sections of the Sample Person Questionnaire. The data was then edited
for completeness, consistency, and illogical values.

## Analytic Notes

In general, analysts are advised to carefully review the question wording in
the OCQ codebook also to make sure they understand question skip patterns and
the definitions employed for Occupation-related variables. Many OCQ questions
need to be considered as an integral part of data collection for other
Questionnaire sections, Exam or Laboratory Components.

Current Job Information:

The primary focus of the OCQ Questionnaire is data collection for the
participant's work within the previous week, i.e. the participant's Current
Job. The participant's Current Job is defined as the main paid job worked
within the last week, including work on a family farm. When an individual
currently worked multiple jobs, the participant was asked to designate one
main job for the interview. Data collected included:

  * The Number of Hours Worked Last Week- All Jobs 
  * Whether the Participant Usually Works 35 or More Hours/Week 
  * Sector Of Employment (Private, Public) 
  * Number Of Months Worked on the Current, Main Job 
  * The Main Reason The Participant Did Not Work Last Week (If not working) 
  * A History of Workplace Tobacco Smoke Exposure 
  * The Participant's Usual Work Schedule/Workshift 
  * Industry & Occupation Group code data (OCD231, OCD241). 

Data on Workplace Tobacco Smoke Exposure:

In NHANES, data for exposure to workplace tobacco smoke is collected only for
the participant's Current Job. Exposure to tobacco smoke is defined as whether
the participant can smell tobacco smoke at work. Also collected is the number
of hours/day of workplace tobacco exposure (OCQ290Q). A value of "0" in
OCQ290Q signifies that workplace exposure to tobacco smoke occurred, but was
less than one hour per day. These OCQ questions are logically related to SMQ
Questionnaire data and laboratory data for serum cotinine.

Longest Job Information:

By design, the survey collected data on both industry and occupation for a
subject's current job, but only data on occupation and duration of employment
was collected for the subject's longest job. Therefore industry information is
not available for the participant's designated longest job. Some industry
information is available in instances where the longest job is the same as the
current job, or was the armed forces (OCD390G=2 or 3). Also, in some instances
industry for the longest job can be inferred from nature of the Sample
Person's longest occupation. The occupational group code data for a sample
person's longest held job is the variable OCD392.

Industry & Occupation Coding:  
  
The U.S. Census Bureau's year 2000 version of its Occupation and Industry
coding system were used to code the NHANES 2005-06 occupation and industry
data (U.S. Census, 2012a). Group code variables are provided that classify a
NHANES sample person to one of 22 industry groups and to one of 23 occupation
groups. The previously public released NHANES 1999-2004 occupation and
industry group code data was based on the earlier 1990 version of the U.S.
Census Bureau occupational data coding system which is not comparable to the
2000 coding system in all respects. Data analysts who wish to combine the
NHANES 1999-2004 occupation group code data with the NHANES 2005-06 occupation
group code data should consult the U.S. Census Bureau's literature on the
comparability of the these 2 versions of the Census Bureau's occupation coding
system before performing their analyses (U.S. Census, 2012b).  
  
Appendix A provides SASâ„¢ program format statements useful for formatting the
NHANES 2005-06 occupation and industry group code data. Appendix B provides
tables showing the detailed U.S. Census occupation and industry source codes
used in creating the NHANES 2005-06 occupation and industry group codes.  
  
NHANES1999+ is a survey of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized
population, therefore by definition persons whose current job is in the active
military service are not chosen as sample persons, however sample persons may
be in the military reserves or National Guard. Also, military occupation codes
are pertinent to the sample person's longest held occupation data. If a
specific civilian occupational title is given in the interview coded for the
military service as the longest held job, then it is coded as such. For
example "aircraft mechanic" or "electronic technician." However all other
specific military occupations are coded according to rank: i.e. military
enlisted personnel, first-line enlisted military supervisors, or military
officers.

The OCQ data were collected as part of the household questionnaire and
therefore the full sample NHANES interview weights should be used for
statistical analysis. However, if the OCQ data are merged with the MEC
examination or laboratory data, then exam sample weights should be used for
analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

Additional bibliographic resource material is available for other NHANES and
National Center for Health Statistics Occupation datasets (Wagener 1993).

Related Datasets:

There are occupation-related items in the NHANES Physical Functioning
questionnaire (PFQ.049; PFQ.051) and a question on veteran's/military service
in the Demographics data file (DEMO_D: DMQMILIT ).
