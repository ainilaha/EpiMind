### Creatinine & Albumin - Urine, Second Exam (L16_2_B)

####  Data File: L16_2_B.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2010

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Second Day Exams**

**  
See the general documentation on Second Day laboratory exams**. See the
general documentation on second day laboratory exams. Also, see the
documentation for the primary exam data for **Laboratory 16**.  
  
Urinary albumin and creatinine were measured.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 16-69 years were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Urinary creatinine  
**  
Creatinine analysis uses a Jaffe rate reaction, in which creatinine reacts
with picrate in an alkaline solution to form a red creatinine-picrate complex.
The reaction is measured with a CX3 analyzer. The rate of the color
development is measured 25.6 sec after sample injection at 520 nm and at 560
nm. The rate difference between the two wavelengths is proportional to the
concentration of creatinine in the reaction cup. The procedures described
below are the standard protocols of the Fairview University Medical Center
(FUMC).  
  
Creatinine, derived from creatine, is released into the plasma at a relatively
constant rate. The amount of creatinine per unit of muscle mass is constant;
therefore, creatinine is the best indicator of impaired kidney function.  
  
**Urinary albumin**  
  
A solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay for the measurement of human urinary
albumin is described by Chavers et al. The fluorescent immunoassay is a
noncompetitive, double-antibody method for the determination of human albumin
in urine. Antibody to human albumin is covalently attached to derivatized
polyacrylamide beads. The solid-phase antibody is reacted with a urine
specimen. The urine albumin-antigen complexes with the solid-phase antibody.  
  
This complex then reacts with fluorescein-labeled antibody. The  
unattached fluorescent antibody is removed by washing during centrifugation.
The fluorescence of the stable solid-phase antibody complex with a
fluorometer. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of urine
albumin present. The standard curve is 0.5-20 µg/mL albumin.  
  
Increased microalbuminuria is a sign of renal disease and may be predictive of
nephropathy risk in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Results of the
fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) are reproducible, and the test is accurate and
sensitive for the detection of human urinary albumin excretion. It is
especially useful for measurement of low levels of urinary albumin not
detectable by dipstick methods. The FIA assay resembles the radio-immunoassay
(RIA) in technique and sensitivity without the potential health hazards
associated with the handling of isotopes in the laboratory.

## Data Processing and Editing

Urine specimens were processed, stored and shipped to University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, Minnesota for analysis. Detailed specimen collection and
processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
Description of the Laboratory Methodology section.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

**The second day exam data was a convenience sample and thus did not have
sample weights.** The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted
with the key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Phlebotomy Examination File includes auxiliary information
such as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire
Data Files and Phlebotomy Examination File may be linked to the laboratory
data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.
