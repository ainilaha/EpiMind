## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

**Inorganic, Ethyl, and Methyl** **Mercury**

Mercury is widespread in the environment and found in its elemental form,
inorganic forms such as mercurous and mercuric, and various organic forms such
as methyl mercury, ethyl mercury, phenyl mercury, and others.  Exposure to
inorganic mercury usually occurs by ingestion. The most significant effect is
on the kidneys, where mercury accumulates, leading to tubular necrosis.
Methyl mercury is more toxic than inorganic mercury. The effects of methyl
mercury include changes in vision, sensory disturbances in the arms and legs,
cognitive disturbances, dermatitis, and muscle wasting. Methyl mercury readily
crosses the blood-brain barrier due to its lipid solubility and accumulates in
the brain where it is slowly converted to inorganic mercury. Ethyl mercury is
another organic form of mercury. Very little is actually known about ethyl
mercury metabolism in humans, including whether it has the same potency as a
neurotoxin, whether the blood concentration is ever significant, and even
whether it crosses the blood-brain barrier.

Uncertainties exist regarding levels of exposure to methyl mercury from fish
consumption and potential health effects resulting from this exposure. Past
estimates of exposure to methyl mercury have been obtained from results of
food consumption surveys and measures of methyl mercury in fish. Measures of a
biomarker of exposure are needed for improved exposure assessments. Blood
measures of total and inorganic mercury are important for evaluating exposure
to mercury in interior latex paints. Blood total mercury can be found in
[P_PBCD](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_PBCD.htm).

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 1 year and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Inorganic, Ethyl, and Methyl Mercury**

The quantification of InHg, MeHg, and EtHg in whole blood samples is performed
using a triple spike isotope dilution (TSID) method employing gas
chromatography (GC) to separate the species followed by introduction into an
ICP-DRC-MS for detection. TSID is a specialized extension of the Isotope
Dilution (ID) technique. TSID measures individual chemical species (inorganic,
methyl and ethyl mercury species) in samples using ID principles. The blood
sample is spiked with known amounts of each Hg species that have been enriched
with isotopic variants of the target element of interest.

The first step of this method involves the addition ("spiking") of enriched
isotopes (199Hg2+, CH3200Hg+, and C2H5201Hg\+ or C2H5198Hg+, 199Hg2, and
CH3201Hg+) to the blood sample. Each Hg species spike is labeled with an
enriched Hg isotope such that its isotopic pattern is unique to the species'
chemical identity (i.e., the manner of isotope spiking is "species specific").
Next, the spiked sample is digested in tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH)
which disassociates bound mercury species from proteins, polypeptides, and
other biomolecules. The digested blood sample with freed mercury species is
chemically reacted ("derivatized") with a reagent that adds 3-carbon chains
(n-propyl groups) to the mercury atom of each species molecule without
compromising species identity. This type of chemical derivatization results in
loss of ionic charge and reduced polarity making each mercury species molecule
volatile so that it can escape the liquid phase and accumulate in the gaseous
phase ("headspace") directly above the sample. Derivatization is performed
inside a partially filled vial sealed with a rubber septa cap that can be
penetrated by a needle.

Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) is a sampling technique that uses a thin
polymer fiber with a hydrophobic coating. The method described here uses a
SPME fiber with a 100 µm coating of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The SPME
assembly consists of the fiber inserted in a stainless steel needle. A key
design feature is that the fiber can be mechanically withdrawn into the needle
during vial septum penetration and then pushed out to expose the fiber to the
headspace. During headspace exposure (the "extraction" step), the gaseous
derivatized Hg species adsorbs onto the PDMS coating of the SPME fiber. When
other factors are held constant, the adsorbed mass increases as a function of
sample concentration. After a predetermined time, the SPME fiber is retracted
into the injection needle, and the needle is withdrawn from the sample vial.
Subsequently, the needle moves to the injector port of the programmable
temperature gradient gas chromatograph, (GC) and on programmatic command,
performs a programmed temperature ramp injection sequence. This action
transfers the propylated inorganic, methyl and ethyl Hg species to the head of
a 30 m capillary GC column which, using He as the carrier gas, ramps the
column temperature to 280°C. The order of chromatographic separation of the Hg
species is based on increasing molecular weight: methylpropylmercury
(derivatized methyl Hg), ethylpropylmercury (derivatized ethyl Hg), followed
by dipropylmercury (derivatized inorganic Hg).  Hg species exiting the GC
column are seen as chromatographic peaks detected using an inductively coupled
argon plasma (ICP) as the ion source and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS)
for mass specific quantification. Species identification is based on
chromatographic retention time. Species-specific isotope ratios are calculated
from integrated peak areas derived from m/z signals corresponding to 199Hg,
200Hg, 201Hg, and 202Hg isotopes or 198Hg, 199Hg, 201Hg, and 202Hg isotopes.
The ICP-MS is equipped with a Dynamic Reaction Cell (DRC™) for minimizing
polyatomic interferences. Operating the ICP-MS in DRC mode has an added
benefit of enhancing Hg signal strength through an effect known as
"collisional focusing" (Baranov, et al.,1999 and Tanner et al., 2000).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [2017-2018
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)and
[2019-2020 NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-
Procedures-Manual-508.pdf)(LPMs). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen
(-30°C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center for Environmental
Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  
  
NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.  
  
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Three calculated variables were created in this data file. The variable were
created using the following formulas:

**LBDIHG:**   The inorganic mercury value in µg/L (LBXIHG) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDIHGSI) by multiplying LBXIHG by 4.99 (Round to 2 decimal points).

**LBDBGE:**   The ethyl mercury value in µg/L (LBXBGE) was converted to nmol/L
(LBDBGE) by multiplying LBXBGE by 4.99 (Round to 2 decimal points).

**LBDBGM:**   The methyl mercury value in µg/L (LBXBGM) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDBGM) by multiplying LBXBGM by 4.99 (Round to 2 decimal points).

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview
documents](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020 approximately 76%
of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017 - March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm)includes auxiliary
information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending "LC" (ex., LBXIHGLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXIHG) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBXIHGLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for Inorganic, Ethyl and Methyl
Mercury:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXIHG |  Mercury, inorganic |  0.21  
LBXBGE |  Mercury, ethyl |  0.064  
LBXBGM |  Mercury, methyl |  0.26
