### Environmental Phenols (EPH_F)

####  Data File: EPH_F.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2011

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Biomonitoring of urinary environmental phenols and parabens is used to
determine their prevalence in humans and the relevance of human exposure in
public health. The sources of human exposure to these phenolic compounds
include industrial pollution, pesticide use, food and bottled water, and
personal care products. Specifically, bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the
manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, which have been used
in baby bottles, as protective coatings on food containers, and as composites
and sealants in dentistry.

Alkylphenols such as 4-tert-octylphenol, are used in the manufacture of
nonionic surfactants used in detergents. Phenols are also used as sunscreen
agents for skin protection, and as UV filters in cosmetic products and
plastics to improve stability (e.g., benzophenone-3 [BP-3]), or used as
bactericides (e.g., triclosan) in soap and other personal care products.

Parabens are short alkyl chain esters of para-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) that
are widely used as preservatives in pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and in such
personal care products as shampoos, hair and shaving products, facial and skin
cleansers, and lotions. Parabens also occur naturally in some foods, including
specific fruit juices and wine. After parabens are absorbed in the body, they
are rapidly hydroyzed and then conjugated to glucuronide or sulfate and
eliminated in the urine. Measurement of urinary environmental phenols and
parabens is useful to assess recent human exposure.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Bisphenol A (BPA) and Alkylphenols (APs) have been previously measured in
biological matrixes by using gas chromatography (GC) or high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with different detection techniques. To
achieve enhanced sensitivity and selectivity, the phenols have been
derivatized to alkyl or acyl derivatives before GC-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
analysis. We have developed a sensitive method for measuring BPA, 4-tert-
octylphenol (tOP), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), one chlorophenols triclosan, and
four parabens. The method uses solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled on-line to
HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). With the use of isotopically
labeled internal standards, the detection limits in 100 μL of urine are 0.1-2
nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), sufficient for measuring urinary levels of
phenols in non-occupationally exposed subjects.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (â20Â°C) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciencesâ quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision (similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary environmental phenols and parabens were measured in a one
third subsample of persons 6 years and over.Â Special sample weights are
required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: â0â and â1ââ. â0â means that the result was at
or above the limit of detection. â1â indicates that the result was below
the limit of detection.

The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection for the environmental phenols (bisphenol A (BPA)
and alkylphenols (APs)) is:Â

Analyte | Item ID | LLOD  
---|---|---  
Urinary Bisphenol A | URXBPH | 0.4  
Urinary 4-tert-octyl phenol | URX4TO | 0.2  
Urinary 2,4,4â-Trichloro-2â-hydroxyphenyl ether (Triclosan) | URXTRS | 2.3  
Urinary 2-Hydroxy-4-metoxybenzophenone (Benzophenone-3) | URXBP3 | 0.4  
Urinary Propyl paraben | URXPPB | 0.2  
Urinary Butyl paraben | URXBUP | 0.2  
Urinary Ethyl paraben | URXEPB | 1  
Urinary Methyl paraben | URXMPB | 1  
  
Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
