### Vision (VIX_C)

####  Data File: VIX_C.xpt

##### First Published: December 2005

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES Vision Examination data will be used to:

  1. measure the prevalence of visual acuity impairment (visual acuity worse than 20/40) in the U.S. population; 
  2. measure the distribution of refractive error in the U.S. population; and 
  3. evaluate functional impairment related to vision. 

The NHANES 2003-2004 Vision Examination consisted of three parts:

Eye Glasses Prescription Determination - For persons 12 years of age and
older, eye glass prescriptions are measured when eye glasses for viewing
distant objects are available.

Distance Visual Acuity and Objective Refraction/Keratometric Evaluation - For
all persons 12 years and older, distance vision is assessed regardless of
whether they wear eyeglasses or contacts; the refraction test measures the
person's refractive error and corneal curvature.

Vision Near Card Test - For persons 50 years and over, visual acuity at near
was assessed.

## Eligible Sample

All sample persons aged 12 years and older are eligible to participate in (1)
automated determination of prescription for eye glasses used to view distant
objects, (2) distance visual acuity assessment and (3) automated objective
refraction/keratometric evaluation. Sample persons aged 50 years and older are
also eligible for the Near Card visual acuity test.

Participants were excluded from the Vision Exam if they were determined to be
completely blind or unable to see in both eyes based on the following question
asked in the Sample Person Household Interview: "With both eyes open, can you
see light?" Participants were also excluded from the exam if they had a severe
eye infection (i.e., purulent discharge with redness and inflammation) in one
or both eyes. A participant wearing an eye patch would not be excluded;
however, the exam would not be conducted on the affected eye.

## Protocol and Procedure

The vision exam included measurements of: 1) eyeglass prescription for glasses
used to view distant objects; 2) presenting visual acuity with current
correction; 3) visual acuity incorporating objective refraction; and 4) near-
vision acuity.

Health technicians completed screening questions that involved observation of
the subject to determine if the medical exclusion criteria applied. The sample
person was then asked additional screening questions (e.g. do they wear any
distance correction) to determine which measurements in the examination
protocol were relevant.

If the sample person wore eyeglasses to see distant objects, their current
eyeglass prescription was determined by using the Nidek Auto Lensmeter Model
LM-990A. The Nidek Auto Refractor Model ARK-760 instrument was used to assess
visual acuity. Presenting visual acuity was tested with whatever distance
correction the participant usually wears, if any. If the participant's visual
acuity with their usual correction was 20/30 or worse, visual acuity was
further assessed using the objective refraction measurements as the
"correction factor" for the participant.

For sample persons aged 50 years and older, near vision was tested with a near
vision card, and usual reading distance was recorded prior to measuring their
presenting distance visual acuity.  
The Nidek Auto Lensmeter Model LM-990A and the Nidek Auto Refractor Model
ARK-760 instruments have been used since 1999.

The Vision Examination Protocol is discussed in detail in the NHANES Vision
Procedures Manual.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

A variety of quality control procedures were used to ensure the accurate and
reliable collection of these data. Calibrations of the lensmeter and the
autorefractor were performed prior to conducting examinations at each survey
location, and weekly thereafter. At regular intervals, NCHS and contractor
staff observed vision examinations conducted in the MEC to evaluate whether
appropriate procedures and techniques were being followed. Retraining sessions
were conducted with all MEC health technicians to review data collection
procedures.

The MEC health technicians conducted the vision examination. These technicians
received 8 weeks of training initially, and subsequently underwent updates and
remedial training as needed. Technicians referred to the Vision Procedures
Manual for specific instructions for the administration of this component.  
For details on the QA/QC process for this component, please refer to the
NHANES Vision Procedures Manual.
