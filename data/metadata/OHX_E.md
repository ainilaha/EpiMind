### Oral Health (OHX_E)

####  Data File: OHX_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2009

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

NHANES is critical for monitoring oral health status, risk indicators for
disease, and access to preventive and treatment services. This component will
address public health significance in areas of surveillance, prevention,
treatment, dental care utilization, health policy, evaluation of Federal
health programs, standardization of new methods, and oral health disparities.
The purpose of this component is to assess the prevalence of oral conditions
and diseases, such as edentulism, denture use, dental sealants, and dental
caries. A concurrent set of questions administered during the household
interview assesses issues related to oral health quality of life.

Surveillance data was collected on dental caries and sequelae for NHANES using
a person-based screening method.  
This method, known as Basic Screening Examination (BSE), differed from
previous NHANES oral health protocols because it did not assess each tooth
surface and the assessments are not made by a dentist. NHANES used a
simplified screening process to collect information on untreated caries,
dental restorations, and dental sealants. The protocol was applied to all
examined persons 5 years or older, and was conducted by a health technologist
(HT) rather than a dentist. In addition to performing the BSE, the HT inquired
about the use of dentures, performed a tooth count, and ascertained the number
of occlusal contacts using existing NHANES protocols.

The NHANES Oral Health Component is a collaborative effort between the
National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division
of Oral Health (NCCDPHP/DOH), and the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS).



## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 5 years and older were eligible for the Tooth count and BSE.
Additionally, persons aged 25 years and older were eligible for a brief
denture questionnaire and functional contacts assessment.



## Protocol and Procedure

The oral health subcomponents for the examination component for participants
are as follows:

1.Â A Denture Questionnaire used to assess denture wear for participants age
25 years and older.

2.Â A Tooth Count used to assess the number of teeth for participants age 5
years and older.

3.Â A Basic Screening Exam used to asses the presence of at least one tooth
with dental decay; at least one tooth with a dental restoration; and at least
one tooth with at least one dental sealant for participants age 5 years and
older.

4.Â A Functional Contacts Assessment for participants age 25 years and older.

5.Â Recommendation of Care findings for participants age 5 years and older.

Â

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The quality of data in this survey was controlled by (1) an intense training
period for the health technologists who were assigned to conduct the oral
health examinations with calibration of OH examiners prior to the beginning of
the survey, (2) periodic monitoring and recalibration of OH examiners, and (3)
periodic retraining of OH examination teams. The reference examiner visited
each team three times per year to observe field operations and to replicate 20
to 25 OH examinations during each visit. The purpose of these "expert
replications" was to determine if the field examiners were maintaining the
examination standards achieved during training and to measure the degree of
deviation, if any, from those standards.

If the inter-rater correlation was not within acceptable limits, retraining
was conducted on site and future monitoring of the field examiner was
intensified. An annual retraining session, for each dental examiner, was also
conducted by the reference examiner to reinforce existing protocols and to
accommodate protocol updates as needed. All OH training, calibration, and
field replicate exams were conducted by the NHANES survey expert dentist.

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES
1999. In the mobile examination centers (MECs), data for the oral health
component were recorded directly onto a computerized data collection form.

The computer system is integrated and it allows for ongoing monitoring of much
of the data. As part of an on-going quality control practice, all data are
reviewed systematically for logical inconsistencies and examiner error.
Internal quality control data reviews indicate that data quality is
acceptable.



## Data Processing and Editing

A limited number of hard edits were employed in the OH Examination. For
example, if an examiner identified all teeth as missing during Tooth Count,
then information for the BSE and Functional Contacts were automatically filled
in with "9's" (cannot assess).



## Analytic Notes

Data for this release (2007-08) should only be combined with oral health data
from the 2005-06 data cycle for analysis purposes.

The analysis of NHANES oral health data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. They also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups. Other
household questionnaire and oral questionnaire files may be linked to the oral
health examination data file using the unique survey participant identifier
SEQN.

Additionally, the NHANES Household Questionnaire Data Files contains
information for an oral health questionnaire inquiring about dental
utilization and oral health related quality of life.

Please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines and the on-line NHANES Tutorial
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
Both of these are available on the NHANES website.
