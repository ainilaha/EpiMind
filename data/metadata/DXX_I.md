### Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry - Whole Body (DXX_I)

####  Data File: DXX_I.xpt

##### First Published: March 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Users of the 2015-2016 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry whole body data
(DXX_I) are encouraged to read the documentation before accessing the data
file.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most widely accepted method of
measuring body composition due in part to its speed, ease of use, and low
radiation exposure (Baran, 1997; Genant, 1996; Heymsfield, 1989; and Njeh,
1999). Whole body DXA scans were administered from 1999-2006 and 2011-2016.
The NHANES DXA examination provides nationally representative data on body
composition (bone and soft tissue), overall, and for age, gender, and
race/ethnic groups, to study the association between body composition and
other health conditions and risk factors, such as cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, hypertension, and physical activity and dietary intake patterns.

The DXA scans provide bone and soft tissue measurements for the total body,
for both arms and both legs, the trunk, and the head. Bone measurements also
were obtained for the pelvis, left and right ribs, thoracic spine, and lumbar
spine. Values for the total body and regions include:

  * Total mass (gm) 
  * Bone mineral content (BMC) (gm)
  * Bone area (cm2)
  * Bone mineral density (BMD) (gm/cm2)
  * Fat mass (gm)
  * Lean mass excluding BMC (gm)
  * Lean mass including BMC (gm)
  * Percent body fat (%)

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 8-59 years were eligible. Pregnant females were excluded
from the DXA examination. Participants who were excluded from the DXA
examination for reasons other than pregnancy were considered to be eligible
nonrespondents. Reasons for exclusion from the DXA examination were as
follows:

  * Pregnancy (positive urine pregnancy test and/or self-report at the time of the DXA examination); 
  * Self-reported history of radiographic contrast material (barium) use in past 7 days; and
  * Self-reported weight over 450 pounds or height over 6'5" (DXA table limitation). 

The variable DXAEXSTS indicates the examination status for the whole body
scan. The codes for DXAEXSTS are as follows:

DXAEXSTS - whole body scan examination status variable  
1 = Whole body scan completed  
2 = Whole body scan completed, but invalid  
3 = Whole body not scanned, pregnancy  
4 = Whole body not scanned, weight > 450 lbs  
5 = Whole body not scanned, height > 6'5"  
6 = Whole body not scanned, other reason  

The main reasons for completed, but invalid, whole body scans were an
insufficient scan area or partial scan. The "Not scanned, other reason" code
includes no time to complete the examination, pregnancy test not completed,
and participant refusal, as well as exclusion for reasons other than
pregnancy, such as a medical test.

## Protocol and Procedure

The whole body scans were acquired on the Hologic Discovery model A
densitometers (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts), using software version
Apex 3.2. The radiation exposure from DXA whole body scans is extremely low at
less than 20 uSv. All scans in the DXX_I file were analyzed with Hologic APEX
version 4.0 software with NHANES BCA option.

The DXA examinations were administered by trained and certified radiology
technologists. Further details of the DXA examination protocol are documented
in the [Body Composition Procedures Manual
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_Body_Composition_Procedures_Manual.pdf)located
on the [NHANES website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

A high level of quality control was maintained throughout the DXA data
collection and scan analysis, including a rigorous phantom scanning schedule.

**Monitoring of Field Staff and Densitometers**  
Staff from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the NHANES
data collection contractor monitored technologist acquisition performance
through in-person observations in the field. Retraining sessions were
conducted with the technologists annually and as needed to reinforce correct
techniques and appropriate protocol. In addition, technologist performance
codes were recorded by the NHANES quality control center at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department of Radiology, during review of
participant scans. The codes documented when the technologist deviated from
acquisition procedures and where scan quality could have been improved. The
performance codes were tracked for each technologist individually and a
summary was reported to NCHS on a quarterly basis. Additional feedback on
technologist performance was provided by the UCSF when problems were noted
during review of the scans. Ongoing communication was maintained throughout
the year among the UCSF, the NCHS, and the data collection contractor
regarding any issues that arose.

Hologic service engineers performed all routine densitometer maintenance and
repairs. Copies of all reports completed by the manufacturer's service
engineers were sent to the UCSF when the scanners were serviced or repaired so
any changes in measurement, as a result of the work, was assessed.

**Scan Analysis**  
Each participant scan and phantom scan was reviewed and analyzed by the UCSF
using standard radiologic techniques and study-specific protocols developed
for NHANES. The Hologic software, APEX v4.0 (Hologic) was used to analyze
whole body scans acquired in 2015-16. Expert review was conducted by the UCSF
on 100% of analyzed participant scans to verify the accuracy and consistency
of the results.

**Invalidity Codes**  
Invalidity codes were applied by the UCSF to indicate the reasons that regions
of the body could not be analyzed accurately. The invalidity codes are
provided in the data file (see the Data Processing and Editing section for a
more detailed description of the invalidity codes).

**Quality Control Scans**  
The quality control phantoms were scanned according to a predetermined
schedule. The Hologic Anthropomorphic Spine Phantom that traveled with each
MEC was scanned daily, as required by the manufacturer, to ensure accurate
calibration of the densitometer. Other MEC-specific phantoms, such as the
Hologic Whole Body Slim-line Phantom and Hologic Tissue Step Phantom, were
scanned 1 to 3 times weekly. A Hologic Spine (HSP-Q96) Phantom, Hologic Block,
and Hologic whole body Phantoms circulated among the MECs and were scanned at
the start of operations at each survey site.

Air scans, phantom-less scans using the whole body scan mode, were used to
describe and monitor the systems' radiographic uniformity across the entire
scan field. Poor uniformity may be caused by poor aperture alignment,
incorrect gantry rotation, non-uniform gain in detectors, etc., that result in
localized inaccuracies in the attenuation values.

The complete phantom scanning schedule is described in the Body Composition
Procedures Manual located on the NHANES website.

In 2015-2016, longitudinal monitoring was conducted through daily spine
phantom scans as required by the manufacturer, whole body slim-line phantom
scans and air scans in order to correct any scanner-related changes in
participant data were conducted 3 times per week. The circulating HSP-Q96,
block and whole body phantoms, which were scanned at the start of operations
at each site, provided additional data for use in longitudinal monitoring and
cross calibration.

The UCSF used the Cumulative Statistics method (CUSUM) and the MEC-specific
phantom data to determine breaks in the calibration of the densitometers over
the course of the survey (Lu, 1996). Multiplicative correction factors were
used to correct the phantom data back to the baseline calibration. The type,
frequency, and magnitude of calibration problems detected in the NHANES data
were similar to those in other studies using stationary densitometers that
were being monitored by UCSF.

After applying the correction factors developed by UCSF from the cross-
calibration and longitudinal phantom data to the NHANES participant data, the
adjusted participant data were compared to unadjusted data. The magnitude of
the changes and reduction in standard errors between the adjusted and
unadjusted data were found to be small and correction of the participant data
not required.

A number of data quality issues were addressed through the quality control
program. Direct feedback given to the technologists regarding acquisition
problems affecting the quality of the scans and yearly refresher training
resulted in improved technologist performance. The rigorous schedule of
quality control scans provided continuous monitoring of machine performance.
The expert review procedures helped to ensure that scan analysis was accurate
and consistent.

## Data Processing and Editing

During the editing process, data were reviewed for completeness, consistency,
and outliers. Back-end edits of the data were performed when errors were
identified. The NHANES BCA option was enabled for whole body scan analysis,
this option adds 5% of lean mass to the fat mass. The correction is based on
the results of an analysis of QDR- 4500A DXA data from seven research
laboratories indicating that the QDR-4500A algorithm underestimated fat mass
and overestimated lean mass (Schoeller, 2005).

**Invalidity Codes**  
Invalidity codes were included in the data file to indicate the reasons that
regions of the body could not be analyzed accurately. Invalidity codes were
applicable to completed scans only (DXAEXSTS= 1 or 2). If a participant was
not scanned, all invalidity codes are missing.

The invalidity codes are provided in the data file as follows:

Invalidity codes  
DXAHEBV = head bone  
DXAHETV = head tissue  
DXALABV = left arm bone  
DXALATV = left arm tissue  
DXALLBV = left leg bone  
DXALLTV = left leg tissue  
DXARABV = right arm bone  
DXARATV = right arm tissue  
DXARLBV = right leg bone  
DXARLTV = right leg tissue  
DXATRBV = trunk bone, includes thoracic and lumbar spine, left and right ribs,
and pelvis  
DXATRTV = trunk tissue

Values for invalidity codes DXAHEBV and DXAHETV:  
0 = Valid data  
1 = Removable or non-removable objects  
5 = Body parts out of scan region  
6 = Positioning problem  
7 = Other

Values for invalidity codes DXALABV, DXALATV, DXARABV, DXARATV, DXALLBV,
DXALLTV, DXARLBV and DXARLTV:  
0 = Valid data  
1 = Removable or non-removable objects  
4= Arm/leg overlap  
5= Body parts out of scan region  
6= Positioning problem  
7= Other

Values for invalidity codes DXATRBV and DXATRTV:  
0 = Valid data  
1 = Removable or non-removable objects  
3 = Excessive x-ray noise due to morbid obesity  
4= Arm/leg overlap  
5= Body parts out of scan region  
6= Positioning problem  
7= Other  

If any region was coded as invalid all bone and soft tissue measurements for
that region were set to missing.

The percentage of eligible survey participants in 2015-2016 with 100% valid
data (all analyzed regions were valid) is shown by age group in Table 1. The
percentage of participants with valid data decreases with increasing age. The
decrease in valid data with age was due primarily to an increase in the number
of participants with implants, such as stents and hip replacements and higher
rates of obesity resulting in invalid truncal data from "obesity noise." The
percentage of participants with 100% valid data also decreases with increasing
BMI due to weight over 450 pounds and "obesity noise" (Table 2).
