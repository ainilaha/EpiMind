### Prescription Medications (RXQ_RX_B)

####  Data File: RXQ_RX_B.xpt

##### First Published: April 2005

##### Last Revised: June 2009

## Component Description

The Dietary Supplements and Prescription Medication Section (DSQ) of the
Sample Person (SP) Questionnaire collects information on

  1. dietary supplement and minerals, 
  2. nonprescription antacids, 
  3. pain relievers, and 
  4. prescription medications. 

The Prescription Medication subsection provides personal interview data on the
use of prescription medications during a 1-month period prior to the survey
date. The NHANES 2001-2002 prescription medication questions are similar to
the NHANES 1999-2000 and NHANES III (1988-1994) questions.

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants are eligible for the prescription medication
questions. Participants over 16 years of age answer for themselves; proxy
respondents answer for participants 16 years of age or younger and for
individuals who could not self-report.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

A trained survey interviewer administrated the survey participant
questionnaire.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Data were routinely examined for discrepancies and erroneous entries. All
medication names entered by the interviewer were compared to the medication
name selected from the database. Products not matched to the drug database
were edited after data collection at NCHS.

## Data Processing and Editing

**Data Collection Methods**

During the household interview, survey participants are asked if they have
taken a medication in the past month for which they needed a prescription.
Those who answer "yes" are asked to show the interviewer the medication
containers of all the products used. For each medication reported, the
interviewer enters the product's complete name from the container into a
computer. If no container is available, the interviewer asks the participant
to verbally report the name of the medication.

When the interviewer enters the medication name into the computer, the name is
automatically matched to a prescription drug database on the computer to
identify an exact match or similar text matches (refer below for details on
the prescription medication database). The interviewer then selects the best
match from a list of possible matches. The original entry of the interviewer
and the product selected from the computer list are saved under separate
variables for quality control purposes. If an exact match of the medication
cannot be found, the interviewer is instructed to select "drug not found on
list" from the list. Interviewers can record up to 20 prescription
medications.

Participants are also asked how long they had been taking the medication and
the main reason for its use.  
The NHANES 2001-2002 prescription medication questions can be accessed in the
Dietary Supplements and Prescription Medications Section of the Sample Person
Questionnaire.

Prescription Medication Questions Included in this Data Release

  * Was any prescription medication taken in the past month 
  * Medication name 
  * Was medication container seen by interviewer 
  * How long was medication taken 
  * Number of prescription medications taken 

The question on the number of canisters of Beta-agonists used in the past
month was not collected after 2000, and therefore is not part of this data
release.  
Prescription Medication Database

NCHS used the Master Drug Database (MDDBÂ®), a proprietary database of Facts
and Comparison (Indianapolis, IN), to assist in data collection. MDDB is a
comprehensive database of all prescription and some nonprescription drug
products available in the U.S. drug market. For NHANES, the MDDB files were
modified and uploaded to a laptop computer and incorporated into a search
engine for use by interviewers in the field. The computer file is updated at
the beginning of each survey year to incorporate changes to the MDDB and
includes products approved and available to the U.S. public in the prior year.

**Data Editing**

**General editing of data:**

If changes were made to the original data, a derived variable was created. The
derived variable is essentially the final version of the variable after
editing and recoding was performed. The derived variable includes the letter
"D" in the third position of the variable name in place of the letter "Q" for
the questionnaire item that is customarily used in NHANES data release files.
The survey questionnaire codebooks include the names and description of the
derived variables.

**Prescription medications incorrectly reported in subsections of
questionnaire:**

Prescription antacids that were incorrectly reported in the nonprescription
antacid section of the questionnaire were removed from the antacid file and
added to the prescription medication file. Prescription medications that were
incorrectly reported in the dietary supplement section were removed from that
file and added to the prescription medication file.

Products reported in the prescription medication section that were only
available as over-the-counter products during 2001-2002 were removed from the
prescription medication file. Any prescription dietary supplement that was
incorrectly reported in the prescription medication section was removed from
the prescription medication section and moved to the dietary supplement
section. The following products were moved to the dietary supplements files:

  * All calcium products except calcium acetate; 
  * All fluoride products except those in topical gel or cream forms (e.g. stannous fluoride); 
  * Over-the-counter niacin, niacinamide, and nicotinic acid. 

All prescription niacin, potassium, and sodium products were retained in the
prescription medication file.  
The variables that record overall prescription drug use (RXD030) and the
number of prescription drugs taken (RXD295) were adjusted for products moved
into or out of the prescription medication file.

**Specific variable editing:**

**RXD030: Have you taken or used any prescription medicines in the past
month?**

This variable was the lead-in question to the series of questions on
prescription medication use. It accounts for all prescription medications
except prescription dietary supplements that are included in the dietary
supplements file (DSQ). A small number of persons refused to answer this
question (coded 7), did not know whether they used a prescription medication
in the past month (coded 9), or have missing data for this question. This
variable was edited and takes into account prescription medications reported
in this section as well as prescription medications moved in from the dietary
supplements or nonprescription antacid sections of the questionnaire.

**RXD295: The number of prescription medicines reported**

This variable was computed at NCHS and represents the total number of
prescription medications reported by the respondent, including those drugs
identified as unknown (RXD240B = 55555). The count has been adjusted for all
prescription medications moved into and those moved out of the prescription
medication section. However, the count is not a comprehensive count of all
prescription medications used by a participant because prescription dietary
supplements are part of the dietary supplements section. There were also
participants who reported the use of prescription medication in the past month
(RXD030 = 1) but did not know the name of the medication (RXD240B = 99999) or
refused to report the name of the medication (RXD240B = 77777). Each product
reported as refused or don't know is still included in the total count of
prescription medications used under RXD295.

**RXD260: For how long have you been taking this medicine?**

This variable was created from a two-part (number and unit) question and
indicates how long the respondent reported taking each prescription
medication. Responses were recorded in days, weeks, months, and years. To
facilitate analysis, all answers were converted to days using conversion
factors of 7 days per week, 30.4 days per month, and 365 days per year. There
were persons who reported the use of a prescription medication but did not
know how long they had been using the medication (RXD260 = 99999) or refused
to report the length of use (RXD260 = 77777). There were also persons who
reported the use of a prescription medication but did not report the length of
use. RXD260 is missing for these persons.

**Creation of additional data release variables:**

**RXD240B: Standard generic ingredient name**

As in NHANES III, all reported medication names were converted to their
standard generic ingredient name for data release. For multi-ingredient
products, the ingredients are listed in alphabetical order (i.e.,
Acetaminophen; Codeine).

There were participants who reported the use of a prescription medication but
did not know the name of the medication or refused to report the name of the
medication. These entries were coded as 99999, don't know, and 77777, refused,
respectively. There were also medications reported with insufficient detail to
accurately identify the exact product, but there was some information about
the drug. These products have been released with the reported name followed by
"-unspecified" (e.g., cardiac drug-unspecified, estrogen-unspecified). The
names of a limited number of reported medications could not be identified by
NCHS as a known prescription product. These entries are counted as
prescription medications, since there is no evidence that they are not, and
have been coded as 55555, unknown drug.

**NHCODE: Standard generic ingredient code**

To assist in data analysis, NCHS assigned a 5-digit generic ingredient drug
code to each generic ingredient name. Refer to Appendix 2 for a list of
standard generic ingredient names and their associated generic codes.

NHCODE is missing for unknown drug (55555), refused (77777), or don't know
(99999) **RXD240B** entries.

**FDACODE1--FDACODE6:  
**Since the creation of the NHANES prescription medication file, the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) has withdrawn the National Drug Code (NDC)
Directory's therapeutic class codes from their internet site and has provided
the following statement:

The Major and Minor Drug Class codes are no longer available at this site. FDA
plans to review the use of the AMA DRUG Evaluation Subscription classification
scheme. This review is necessary because this classification scheme has not
been updated since 1976 and therefore many new molecular entities are not
included.

However, NCHS has decided to maintain the FDA/NDC therapeutic class codes on
the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 prescription data files until another
nonproprietary classification system is available for use by NCHS. Please be
aware that FDA no longer supports this system.

Similar to NHANES III and NHANES 1999-2000, therapeutic drug class codes were
assigned based on FDA's National Drug Code Directory. Specifically, FDA/NDC's
Formulation Data File and Drug Class Data File (from July 2004) were used to
assign up to a maximum of six drug class codes for each generic ingredient
name.

As previously stated on FDA's website, "The major drug class is a general
therapeutic or pharmacological classification scheme for drug products
reported to the FDA under the provisions of the Drug Listing Act. The
classification scheme used was based on the AMA DRUG EVALUATIONS SUBSCRIPTION
and generally follows the organization of material in that publication. The
drug class for each product was determined by the labeled indication. The
major (ending with "00") and minor drug class codes and their definitions are
listed in FDA's NDC directory". NCHS used this classification system because
the files are nonproprietary and can be released to the public.

If a product has more than one drug class code, the codes were recorded in
numerical order, with a maximum of six codes, and were not recorded based on
primary, secondary, or tertiary drug action or response. There were some
products that were not identified in the FDA/NDC Directory and, therefore, do
not have an FDA/NDC drug class code. NCHS assigned a code of 99999 to these
products. Some products were assigned codes by NCHS (e.g., Latanoprost = 1566;
Cerivastatin Sodium = 0912; Allergy Pills-Unspecified = 1900). "Unspecified"
drugs were assigned to a drug class code if there was enough information to
identify a drug class. "Unknown" drugs were not assigned a drug class code.
See Appendix 1 for a listing of the drug class codes and descriptions.

The nine medications listed below matched to more than six FDA/NDC drug class
codes. For these products, NCHS made a decision about which six codes to
retain.

  * Aspirin; Butalbital; Caffeine 
  * Erythromycin 
  * Heparin Sodium 
  * Hydrocortisone 
  * Hydroxyzine Hydrochloride 
  * Methotrexate Sodium 
  * Metronidazole 
  * Sodium Chloride 
  * Triamcinolone Acetonide 

**Drug Database for Data Update:**

Since the 2003-2004 survey, NCHS has used the Lexicon PlusÂ® , a proprietary
database of Cerner Multum, Inc. to assist in data editing and release. To
facilitate data analysis, NCHS decided to update the NHANES 2001-2002
prescription medication file with the Multum Lexicon therapeutic
classification system. For additional information refer to the RXQ_DRUG
documentation.

In accordance with the license agreement, NCHS publications, tabulations, and
software applications should cite the Multum Lexicon as the source and basis
for the coding and classification of the NHANES drug data.

**Variable added to this updated prescription medication file:**

**RXDDRGID: Generic drug code**

All standard generic ingredient names (RXD240B) were linked to generic drug
names from Multum's Lexicon Drug Database through exact or similar name
matches. A unique generic drug code (RXDDRGID) associated with each generic
drug name from Multum's Lexicon Drug Database was added to the NHANES
2001-2002 prescription medication file. In some cases, one standard generic
ingredient name may be linked to more than one Lexicon generic drug codes.
These products have been reviewed and assigned appropriate Lexicon generic
drug codes based on entered or selected product names recorded by survey
interviewers, and/or reasons of taking the medications reported by survey
participants. For example, a drug "BETAXOLOL HYDROCHLORIDE" was initially
linked to a Lexicon generic drug code "d00176" ("BETAXOLOL"). However a
Lexicon generic drug code "d04038" ("BETAXOLOL OPHTHMATIC") was assigned if
participants reported using the topical form of this product for glaucoma. In
other cases, more than one standard generic ingredient names may be linked to
the same Lexicon generic drug code. For example, RXD240B entries "PENICILLIN V
POTASSIUM" and "PENICILIN-UNSPECIFIED" were linked to a generic drug code,
"d00116" (i.e., "PENICILLIN" in the Lexicon Drug Database). In addition, there
were some drug names reported by NHANES' participants that were not found in
the Lexicon Drug Database. These have been assigned unique drug codes
beginning with an "a" or "h". Unspecified products with known therapeutic
action were coded beginning with a "c" and followed by their respective Multum
therapeutic category code. RXDDRGID is missing for unknown drugs (55555),
refused (77777), or don't know (99999) RXD240B entries.

Therapeutic class codes associated with a generic drug code are found in a
separate data release file, **RXQ_DRUG**.

**RXDDRGID** is not equal to the variable NHCODE.

## Analytic Notes

RXD295 provides a count of all prescription products reported in the
prescription medication section adjusting for products moved into or out of
the final file. The count includes products reported as "refused" or "don't
know" by participants who reported they had taken a prescription medication
but did not know the name of the medication or refused to report the name of
the medication. Drugs released as "unknown drug" are also included in the
count. However, prescription supplements in the Dietary Supplements File are
not included in the total count. Therefore, this variable does not provide a
comprehensive count of all prescription products used by the survey
participants.

In some cases it may appear as though respondents reported the same
prescription drug more than once. That is, the same generic ingredient name
and product code may be listed more than once. There are several reasons for
these duplications. Respondents may have reported different brand name
medications which had the same generic ingredient name (e.g., "Adalat" vs.
"Procardia"), the medications may have been different forms or dosages of the
same product, or the participant may have reported different lengths of use or
reasons for use of the products. There were a few cases where the respondent
did report the exact same drug more than once, with the same length of use,
and reason for use. In these cases, since the interviewer recorded that a
separate medication container was seen for each reported drug, both mentions
of the drug were retained in the file.

During the data editing process, outlier values were examined. When there was
insufficient information to conclude that values were invalid, they were left
in the data set. Analysts should examine the distribution of the data and
consider whether or not it is appropriate to include or exclude extreme values
in a given analysis.

All generic ingredient names reported in the prescription medication file were
reviewed by the Disclosure Review Board at NCHS. Certain medications were
found to be a potential disclosure risk. These drugs were recoded to 55555,
unknown drug.

Analysts should be cautious when using the FDA/NDC therapeutic class codes
because the FDA no longer supports this classification system and withdrew the
codes from their internet site at the beginning of 2005. These codes, however,
can still be used to provide a preliminary, yet crude, look at a particular
class of drugs. However, analysts should examine each drug and make decisions
about which drugs to include or exclude from a specific therapeutic class and
not solely use the FDA/NDC codes to determine the drug class.

**Data File Structure**

There are two files related to the prescription drug data. The contents of
each file are described below. The files can be linked by RXDDRGID.

The prescription medication file named RXQ_RX_B is a product level file.
Therefore, participants who reported the use of multiple prescription
medications will have multiple records, i.e. a record for each product.

The drug information file named RXQ_DRUG contains therapeutic drug class
information on all drugs reported by NHANES participants. It contains drug (up
to 4) and ingredient (up to 6) therapeutic category codes for each drug. It
also has a variable that identifies if the drug is made up of a single or
multiple ingredients.
