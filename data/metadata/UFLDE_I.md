### Fluoride - Urine (UFLDE_I)

####  Data File: UFLDE_I.xpt

##### First Published: November 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Fluoride is a natural element found at varying concentrations in drinking
water and soil. Water and water-based beverages are the primary source of
dietary fluoride. Approximately 80% of dietary fluoride comes from tap and
bottled water (Palmer, 2005 and EPA, 2010). Fluoride is voluntarily added to
some drinking water systems as a public health measure for reducing the
incidence of cavities among the treated population. The decision to fluoridate
a water supply is made by the state or local municipality and is not mandated
by EPA or any other federal entity. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) provides recommendations about the optimal levels of fluoride
in drinking water needed to prevent tooth decay. For community water systems
that add fluoride to their water, the U.S. Public Health Service (USPHS)
recommends a fluoride concentration of 0.7 mg/L (parts per million [ppm]) to
maintain tooth decay prevention benefits and reduce the risk of dental
fluorosis (Gooch, 2015). Kidneys represent the major route of fluoride removal
from the body. Under normal conditions, roughly 60% of fluoride absorbed each
day by healthy adults (18-75 years) is excreted in urine.

In 2010, a panel of federal scientists representing CDC/Division of Oral
Health and National Institute of Dental (DOH) and Craniofacial Research
(NIDCR) participated in the development of a new HHS recommendation for
optimal fluoride level in drinking water (community water fluoridation), as
well as the development of guidelines for maximum fluoride levels in naturally
fluoridated water. One of the recommendations of the federal panel was to
strengthen the surveillance of dental caries and dental fluorosis with
emphasis on determining fluoride exposures.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 to 19 years were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Fluoride is measured in urine samples using an ion-selective electrode (ISE),
which measures the activity of fluoride ions as a voltage response. The
voltage response is proportional to the concentration of free fluoride ions in
solution when the ionic strength is fixed. It is therefore essential that a
total ionic strength adjustment buffer (TISAB) is used with each sample. In
addition to adjusting the ionic strength with sodium chloride (NaCl), TISAB
contains a complexing agent that binds with interfering ions and buffers the
solution to a pH of 5 thus reducing OH- and HF interferences.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the 2015-2016 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Fluoride â Urine Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/labmethods/UFLDE-I-
MET-508.pdf) (November 2022)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM).
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)Vials
are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)  
**Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  
  
NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981) when
testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered
during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control
pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015 - 2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Ftutorials%2Findex.htm)for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data files using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analyte in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending
"LC" (ex., URDUFLLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed UBX (ex., URXUFL) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDUFLLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in mg/L) for fluoride:

Variable Name |  Analyte Description |  LLOD  
---|---|---  
 Fluoride, Urine  |   URXUFL |   0.144 mg/L
