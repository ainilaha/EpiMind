## Component Description

Flame retardants (FRs) are either additive or reactive ingredients applied to
household and consumer products to reduce the product's flammability and to
meet state and federal fire safety standards and regulations. Until recently,
a dominant class of FR additives used for household products was
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are persistent and can
accumulate in the environment (de Wit, 2002; Law et. al., 2006; Stapleton et.
al., 2012). Flame retardant formulations containing chlorinated and non-
chlorinated organophosphates and non-PBDE brominated chemicals have entered
consumers' markets as PBDEs have been phased-out in many countries (van der
Veen and de Boer, 2012).  Some of these compounds used in flame retardant
formulations are: triphenyl phosphate, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate,
tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tri-cresyl
phosphates, tributyl phosphate, tribenzyl phosphate, isopropyl triphenyl
phosphates, tertbutyltriphenyl phosphates, and
2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate. We recently developed a method to
measure metabolites of these compounds that can be used as exposure
biomarkers: diphenyl phosphate, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate),
bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, di-cresyl
phosphates, dibutyl phosphate, dibenzyl phosphate, 2-((isopropyl)phenyl)phenyl
phosphate (¡PPPP), 4-((tert-butyl)phenyl)phenyl phosphate (tBPPP), and
2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic acid.

## Eligible Sample

A full sample of participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
participants aged 6 years and older, who gave consent for their samples to be
used in future research and had stored urine samples from 2015-2016, were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The method uses 0.2 mL urine and is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of urinary
conjugates of the target analytes, automated off-line solid phase extraction,
reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography separation, and isotope
dilution-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection
(Jayatilaka et. al., 2019).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The analytical measurements were conducted following strict quality
control/quality assurance CLIA guidelines. Along with the study samples, each
analytical run included high- and low-concentration quality control materials
(QCMs) and reagent blanks to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
The concentrations of the high-concentration QCMs and the low-concentration
QCMs, averaged to obtain one measurement of high-concentration QCM and low-
concentration QCM for each run, were evaluated using standard statistical
probability rules (Caudill et. al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all analyses were complete. The data were not edited.

## Analytic Notes

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Special Subsample Weights**

Special subsample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data (WTSSBI2Y).

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in this file.
URXUCR can be found in the data file titled "Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**  
  
The detection limits varied for the analytes in the data set. Two variables
are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in "L" (ex.,
SSDPHPL) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: the
value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1"
indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The other variable
(ex., SSDPHP) provides the analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with
analytic results below the limit of detection (ex., SSDPHPL=1), an imputed
fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower
limit of detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limits of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for DPhP, BDCPP, BCPP, BCEtP,
DCP, DBuP, DBzP, iPPPP, tBPPP, and TBBA are:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Name** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
SSDPHP |  Diphenyl phosphate (µg/L) |  0.10  
SSBDCPP |  Bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (µg/L) |  0.10  
SSBCPP |  Bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (µg/L) |  0.10  
SSBCEP |  Bis(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (µg/L) |  0.10  
SSDCP |  Di-cresyl phosphates (µg/L) |  0.50  
SSDBUP |  Dibutyl phosphate (µg/L) |  0.10  
SSDBZP |  Dibenzyl phosphate (µg/L) |  0.05  
SSTBBA |  2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic acid (µg/L) |  0.05  
SSIPPP |  2-((isopropyl)phenyl)phenyl phosphate (µg/L) |  0.05  
SSBPPP |  4-((tert-butyl)phenyl)phenyl phosphate (µg/L) |  0.05  
  


**Interferences:**

Blanks in an analyte results field represent missing values in cases when the
presence of interferences precluded obtaining a valid numeric result.
