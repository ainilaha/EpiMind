### Pesticides - Environmental - Urine (L24PP_C)

####  Data File: L24PP_C.xpt

#####  First Published: March 2010

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Biomonitoring of urinary environmental phenols is used to determine prevalence
of human exposure and the relevance of human exposure in public health. The
sources of human exposure to these phenolic compounds include industrial
pollution, pesticides, food, and drinking water.

Chlorophenols have been used in the wood preservation industry, as
intermediates in the production of pesticides, and as disinfectants or
fungicides for industrial and indoor home use. Clorophenols are also by-
products of waste water and municipal drinking water disinfection with
chlorine. The manufacture of other chlorinated aromatic compounds can produce
chlorophenols as byproducts. 2,4-Dichlorophenol sources include water
chlorination, wood pulp bleaching, pesticide manufacturing, and environmental
degradation of the herbicide 2.4-diphenoxyacetic acid. 2,5-Dichlorophenol is a
metabolite of 1,4-dichlorobenzene and has industrial uses including dye and
chemical synthesis and resin production. 2,4,5- and 2,4,6-Trichlorophenol are
metabolites of several organochlorine pesticides. Although they may still be
used in production of certain fungicides, these chemicals are no longer
commercially manufactured but may occur in small amounts in chlorinated
drinking water, and they may be produced during combustion of natural
materials or detected in chlorinated waste water. Orthophenylphenol is an
antimicrobial agent used in agriculture, with limited use on food crops, but
used as a fungicide on ornamental plants and turf and as a wood and paint
preservative. Thus, there are numerous sources for human exposure to these
chlorophenols, encompassing food, drinking water, pesticide use, and contact
with contaminated or treated materials. Measurement of urinary metabolites of
chlorophenols is useful to assess recent human exposure.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Bisphenol A (BPA) and Alkylphenols (APs) have been previously measured in
biological matrixes by using gas chromatography (GC) or high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with different detection techniques. To
achieve enhanced sensitivity and selectivity, the phenols have been
derivatized to alkyl or acyl derivatives before GC-mass spectrometry (GC/MS)
analysis (Brock, et al., 2001; Jeannot, et al., 2002; Kojima, et al., 2003;
Lerch and Zinn, 2003; Louter, et al., 1997; Rinken, 2002; Schonfelder, et al.,
2002; Zafra, et al., 2002; Rosenfeld and Moharir, 1991). We have developed a
sensitive method for measuring BPA, 4-tert-octylphenol (tOP), benzophenone-3
(BP-3), one chlorophenols triclosan, and four parabens. The method uses solid
phase extraction (SPE) coupled on-line to HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS). With the use of isotopically labeled internal standards, the
detection limits in 100 μL of urine are 0.1-2 nanograms per milliliter
(ng/mL), sufficient for measuring urinary levels of phenols in non-
occupationally exposed subjects.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. Detailed
specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are stored
under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to National
Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision (similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary environmentals were measured in a one third subsample of
persons 6 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these
data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this
data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: â0â and â1ââ. â0â means that the result was at
or above the limit of detection. â1â indicates that the result was below
the limit of detection.

The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.Â Both of these are available on the
NHANES website.
