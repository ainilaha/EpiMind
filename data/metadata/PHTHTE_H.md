### Phthalates and Plasticizers Metabolites - Urine (PHTHTE_H)

####  Data File: PHTHTE_H.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2016

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and
harder to break. They are often called plasticizers. Some phthalates are used
as solvents (dissolving agents) for other materials. They are used in many
products, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, detergents, lubricating oils,
automotive plastics, plastic clothes (raincoats), and personal-care products
(soaps, shampoos, hair sprays, and nail polishes). Phthalates are used widely
in polyvinyl chloride plastics, which are used to make products such as
plastic packaging film and sheets, garden hoses, inflatable toys, blood-
storage containers, and medical tubing. 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid,
diisononyl ester (DINCH) is used as a replacement of some high molecular
weight phthalates. Once phthalates or DINCH enter a person's body, they are
converted into breakdown products (metabolites) that pass out quickly in
urine. Biomeasures of phthalates and phthalates alternatives in humans are
necessary to evaluate potential human health effects from exposure to these
chemicals.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The test principle utilizes high performance liquid chromatography-
electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for the
quantitative detection in urine of the following metabolites: monoethyl
phthalate (MEP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP),
mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP),
monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), monoisononyl phthalate (MNP),
mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)
phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP),
monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP), monocarboxynonyl phthalate (MCNP), and
cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono(hydroxy-isononyl) ester (MHNCH) (Silva,
et al., 2007). Urine samples are processed using enzymatic deconjugation of
the glucuronidated metabolites followed by on-line solid phase extraction
(SPE) coupled with reversed phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Assay precision is improved
by incorporating isotopically-labeled internal standards of the phthalate
metabolites and MHNCH. In addition, 4-methyl umbelliferyl glucuronide is used
to monitor deconjugation efficiency. This selective method allows for rapid
detection of metabolites of commonly used phthalates and DINCH in human urine
with limits of detection in the low ng/mL range.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the method used.  

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Phthalates and Phthalate Alternative
Metabolites](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/PHTHTE_H_MET_Phthalates.pdf)
(December 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Specimen vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until
they are shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.  

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels are maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Westgard, et al., 1981).

  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary phthalates and plasticizers metabolites were measured in a one third
subsample of persons 6 years and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDCNPLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDCNPLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXCNP) provides the
analytic result for the analyte.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/analytic_guidelines_11_12.pdf)
and the on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
