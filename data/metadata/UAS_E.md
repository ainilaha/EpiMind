### Arsenics - Total & Speciated - Urine (UAS_E)

####  Data File: UAS_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2009

#####  Last Revised: September 2011

## Component Description

Arsenic is widely distributed in the earthâs crust and is found most often
in ground water rather than surface water. People encounter arsenic in many
chemical forms that vary greatly in toxicity. The most toxic of the naturally-
occurring arsenic compounds are inorganic forms of arsenic and their
methylated metabolites. Less toxic are the organic arsenic compounds. Although
this method does not reveal the chemical form of arsenic to which a person is
exposed, it is sensitive enough to screen urine specimens rapidly from people
thought to be exposed to arsenic or to evaluate total environmental or other
total non-occupational exposure to arsenic.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older, who met the subsample requirements, were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**1\. Total arsenc**

The method described in this manual assesses arsenic exposure by analyzing
urine through the use of inductively coupled-plasma dynamic reaction cell-mass
spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS). Urine is analyzed because urinary excretion is the
major pathway for eliminating arsenic from the mammalian body (Vahter ME,
1988). This method achieves rapid and accurate quantification of total urinary
arsenic.

Total urine arsenic concentrations are determined by using ICP-DRC-MS. This
multielement analytical technique is based on quadrupole ICP-MS technology
(Date AR et al., 1989) and includes DRCâ¢ technology (Tanner SD et al. ,
1999), which minimizes or eliminates much argon-based polyatomic interference.
Coupling radio frequency power into a flowing argon stream seeded with
electrons creates the plasma, the heat source, which is ionized gas suspended
in a magnetic field. Predominant species in the plasma are positive argon ions
and electrons. Diluted urine samples are converted into an aerosol by using a
nebulizer inserted within a spray chamber. A portion of the aerosol is
transported through the spray chamber and then through the central channel of
the plasma, where it is exposed to temperatures of 6000-8000 ÂºK. This thermal
energy atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating
at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer,
which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer permits
detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio in rapid sequence, which allows
the determination of individual isotopes of an element. Once inside the mass
spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion optics, then through DRCâ¢, and
finally through the mass-analyzing quadrupole before being detected as they
strike the surface of the detector. The ion optics uses an electrical field to
focus the ion beam into the DRCâ¢. The DRCâ¢ component is pressurized with
an appropriate reaction gas and contains a quadrupole. In the DRCâ¢,
elimination or reduction of argon-based polyatomic interferences takes place
through the interaction of the reaction gas with the interfering polyatomic
species in the incoming ion beam. The quadrupole in the DRCâ¢ allows
elimination of unwanted reaction by-products that would otherwise react to
form new interferences. Electrical signals, resulting from the detection of
the ions, are processed into digital information that is used to indicate the
intensity of the ions, and subsequently the concentration of the element. In
this method, arsenic (isotope mass 75) and gallium (isotope mass 71) or
tellurium (isotope mass 126) is measured in urine by ICP-DRC-MS, using
argon/hydrogen (90%/10%, respectively) as a reaction gas (Neubauer K. et al.,
1999). Urine samples are diluted 1:9 with 2% (v/v) double-distilled nitric
acid containing gallium or tellurium for internal standardization.

**2\. Speciated arsenics**

Â (arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, trimethylarsine oxide, monomethylarsonic
acid, dimethylarsinic acid, arsenous (III) acid, arsenic (V) acid)

The concentration of speciated arsenics is determined by using high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate the species coupled to an
ICP-DRC-MS to detect the arsenic species. This analytical technique is based
on separation by anion-exchange chromatography (IC), followed by detection
using quadrupole ICP-MS technology, and includes DRCâ¢ technology (Baranov VI
et al., 1999), which minimizes or eliminates many argon-based polyatomic
interferences (Tanner S et al., 2000)Â will require 0.5 mL of urine. Arsenic
species column separation is largely achieved due to differences in charge-
charge interactions of each negatively-charged arsenic component in the mobile
phase, with the positively-charged quaternary ammonium groups bound at the
columnâs solid-liquid interface. Upon exit from the column, the
chromatographic eluent goes through a nebulizer, where it is converted into an
aerosol upon entering the spray chamber.

Carried by a stream of argon gas, a portion of the aerosol is transported
through the spray chamber and then through the central channel of the plasma,
where it is heated to temperatures of 6000-8000Â° K. This thermal energy
atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating
at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer,
which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr.

The mass spectrometer permits detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio
in rapid sequence, which allows the determination of individual isotopes of an
element. Once inside the mass spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion
optics, then through the DRCâ¢, and finally through the mass-analyzing
quadrupole before being detected as they strike the surface of the detector.
The ion optics uses an electrical field to focus the ion beam into the DRCâ¢.

The DRCâ¢ component is pressurized with an appropriate reaction gas and
contains a quadrupole. In the DRCâ¢, elimination or reduction of argon-based
polyatomic interferences takes place through the interaction of the reaction
gas with the interfering polyatomic species in the incoming ion beam. The
quadrupole in the DRCâ¢ allows elimination of unwanted reaction by-products
that would otherwise react to form new interferences.

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation, during
unscheduled visits, to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and
the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation, and testing
procedures. Constructive feedback are given to each staff person. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill
levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind, split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition,
contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all
specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports, containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations, are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Scienceâs quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary speciated arsenic were obtained in a one-third subsample
of persons 6 years and over. Therefore, special sample weights (WTSA2YR) are
required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the arsenics in the data set.

Lower detection limits for the total and speciated arsenics  
Urinary total arsenic 0.74 Âµg/L  
Urinary arsenous acid 1.2 Âµg/L  
Urinary Arsenic acid 1.0 Âµg/L  
Urinary Arsenobetaine 0.4 Âµg/L  
Urinary Arsenocholine 0.6 Âµg/L  
Urinary Dimethylarsonic acid 1.7 Âµg/L  
Urinary Monomethylarsonic acid 0.9 Âµg/L  
Urinary Trimethylarsine Oxide 1.0 Âµg/L

The variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website.
