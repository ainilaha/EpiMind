### Osteoporosis (P_OSQ)

####  Data File: P_OSQ.xpt

##### First Published: October 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

The Osteoporosis questionnaire (variable name prefix OSQ) section provides
personal interview data on the following:

  * Self-reported information regarding fractured hip, wrist, or spine 
  * Number of times hip, wrist, or spine was fractured 
  * Age at each hip, wrist, or spine fracture 
  * Amount of trauma causing each hip, wrist, or spine fracture 
  * Fractures of any other bones, amount of trauma causing the fractures, and age when the fractures occurred 
  * Whether the participant has ever been diagnosed as having osteoporosis 
  * If diagnosed with osteoporosis, whether the participant has been treated by prescription medicine (Fosamax, Boniva, Actonel, Reclast, Miacalcin, Fortical, Evista or Forteo) 
  * Participant use of prednisone or cortisone pills 
  * Whether either of the participant's biological parents had been diagnosed as having osteoporosis 
  * Whether the participant's mother had ever fractured her hip, and if so, at what age 
  * Whether the participant's father had ever fractured his hip, and if so, at what age 

Several of the questions in this section also were included in the NHANES III:
1988-94 questionnaires under Musculoskeletal Conditions.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 50 years and over in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

This questionnaire section was conducted, in the home, using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Hand cards showing response
categories were used for some questions.  

The 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 Interviewer Procedure Manuals and the Osteoporosis
Sample Person Questionnaire can be found on the [NHANES
website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of the file.

For details on the quality assurance/quality control process for this
component, please refer to the NHANES 2017-18 and 2019-2020 Interviewer
Procedure Manuals on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

For participants aged 80 and over, responses to OSD030a (How old were you when
you fractured your hip?), OSD030b (how old were you when you fractured your
wrist?), OSD030c (How old were you when you fractured your spine?), and OSQ110
(How old were you when you fractured (other bones) after you were 20 years of
age) were coded as 80 years. This was done to address data disclosure concerns
and to be consistent with age codes in the demographic and other sample person
files.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting
sample weights in the demographic file should be used to calculate estimates
from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for
independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Since these data are collected during the household questionnaire, interview
weights should be used. However, if these data are merged with MEC exam data,
exam sample weights should be used for the analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
online [NHANES
tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
