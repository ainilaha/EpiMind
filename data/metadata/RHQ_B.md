# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2001-2002 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Reproductive Health (RHQ_B)

####  Data File: RHQ_B.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2004

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

This section contains questions for women only on reproductive health
including menstrual history, pregnancy history, lactation, oral contraceptive
and hormone replacement therapy use, and other related conditions.

**Topics in the RHQ Section:**

  * Menstrual history: age at first menstruation, menopause, and menstrual cycle irregularity. 
  * Current pregnancy, pregnancy history. 
  * Birth weight of children and breast-feeding patterns. 
  * History and current use of oral contraceptive and hormone replacement therapy. 

## Eligible Sample

Female MEC examination participants ages 12 years and older.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

Mobile Examination Center (MEC) private face-to-face interview.

## Analytic Notes

The reproductive health questionnaire is a complex, detailed set of questions
that includes the administration of questions according to age group or skip
patterns based on responses to various reproductive health conditions. While
data were reviewed and edited for completeness and illogical values,
inconsistencies in the responses to these self-reported questions remain. Some
of the inconsistencies are discussed below. Data analysts are encouraged to
carefully review all variables of interest prior to data analysis.

**RHQ030:** Regular periods in the past 12 months. There are a few instances
where women who were pregnant at the time of the interview reported having had
"regular periods in the past 12 months. These women all reported that they
were pregnant in RHQ141.

**RHD080:** Days since last period. Women who reported having had a menstrual
period in the past 2 months were asked to report the date of their last
menstrual period. The derived variable was created by subtracting the number
of days between the reported month and day the period began and the date of
the MEC Interview. Note that for this variable extreme values (>60 days) were
retained and should be carefully examined prior to analysis. There are several
instances of women who reported that they were currently menstruating (RHQ050)
who provided a date which may indicate that they were reporting on the last
month's menstrual period.

**RHD130:** Ever pregnant. The derived variable includes responses from two
questions, RHQ040 and

**RHQ130:** If women reported in question RHQ040 that they were currently
pregnant, they were not asked the question whether they had ever been
pregnant, but coded as "1" in RHD130.

**RHQ141:** Current pregnancy status (self-report). This is the same as
question RHQ140 in 1999-2000 data release but target age range was broadened
to include women ages 12-60 years, as compared to 15-49 years. See also
Laboratory file variable URXPREG: urine pregnancy test result and Demographic
file variable, RIDPREG, a variable based on both self-report (RHQ141) and
laboratory test results (URXPREG).

**RHQ151:** Month of pregnancy. Same as question RHQ150 in 1999-2000 data
release but target age range includes women 12-60 years.

  
**RHD170:** Number of pregnancies resulting in live births. If the total
number of pregnancies resulting in live births was greater than 11, the number
was recoded to 11 for the purpose of confidentiality. Note: there are a few
instances where the number of pregnancies resulting in a live birth is greater
than the number of pregnancies. This may have occurred as a result of women
reporting number of lives births rather than "pregnancies" resulting in live
births.

**RHD280:** Had a hysterectomy. Women who were not asked the question because
they were pregnant were coded as "2" in RHD280.

**RHQ290:** Age at hysterectomy. There are instances whereby women reported an
age of hysterectomy that is earlier than the age of last menstrual period
(RHD060).

**RHD350:** Fallopian tubes ever cut, tied, or removed. Women who were not
asked the question because they were pregnant were coded as "2" in RHD350.
