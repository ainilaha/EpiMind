### Cotinine and Hydroxycotinine - Serum (COT_J)

####  Data File: COT_J.xpt

##### First Published: March 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The specific aims of the component are: 1) to measure the prevalence and
extent of tobacco use; 2) to estimate the extent of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), and determine trends in exposure to ETS; and 3) to
describe the relationship between tobacco use (as well as exposure to ETS) and
chronic health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Cotinine and trans-3'-hydroxycotinine (hydroxycotinine) are the primary
metabolites of nicotine. The concentrations of cotinine and hydroxycotinine in
body fluids can be used as markers for active smoking and as indices for
secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure. Because their concentrations are greater and
their elimination half-lives significantly longer, these metabolites are
generally preferred over nicotine itself as biomarkers. Cotinine, the primary
proximal metabolite of nicotine, is generally regarded as the marker of
choice. The estimated elimination half-life of cotinine is about 15-20 hours;
by contrast, the half-life of nicotine is only 0.5-3 hours. The half-life of
hydroxycotinine is approximately 5-6 hours, but when hydroxycotinine is
generated from cotinine, its elimination half-life becomes similar to that of
cotinine.

Cotinine and hydroxycotinine can be measured in serum, urine, and salivaâthe
half-life of cotinine in all three fluids is essentially the same. Cotinine
concentrations tend to be three to eight times higher in urine than in serum;
however, plasma or serum is the fluid of choice for studies requiring a
quantitative assessment of exposure. For that reason, serum was chosen as the
matrix for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
cotinine analyses. In serum, hydroxycotinine concentrations tend to be two to
four times lower than cotinine concentrations.

The tobacco component for NHANES also included questionnaire items on current
and past use of cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Questions
were asked regarding exposure to ETS at home, at work, and in utero among
children. In addition, use of nicotine replacement products (e.g., gum and
patch) was collected using questionnaires.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 3 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum cotinine and hydroxycotinine are measured by an isotope-dilution high-
performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization
tandem mass spectrometric (ID HPLC-APCI MS/MS) method. Briefly, the serum
sample is spiked with methyl-D3-cotinine and methyl-D3-hydroxycotinine as
internal standards. The sample is basified and then applied to a supported
liquid extraction (SLE) plate. The analytes are extracted with an
isopropanol/methylene chloride mixture, the organic extract is concentrated,
and the residue is injected onto a C18 HPLC column. The eluent from these
injections is monitored by APCI-MS/MS. The m/z 80 product ion from the m/z 177
quasi-molecular ion is measured for cotinine and the m/z 80 product ion from
the m/z 193 quasi-molecular ion is measured for hydroxycotinine. Additional
ions for the internal standards and for confirmation are also monitored for
the respective compounds. Analyte concentrations are derived from the area
ratios of native-to-labeled compounds in the sample by comparisons to a
standard curve.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Cotinine and Hydroxycotinine in Serum Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/COT-J-
MET-508.pdf) (March 2020)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Sample Weights**

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the length of fast, and the time
of venipuncture.

The laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
"Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDCOTLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex. LBDCOTLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXCOT)
provides the analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ng/mL) for Cotinine and Hydroxycotinine
in serum:

**VARIABLE** |  **SAS LABEL** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXCOT |  Cotinine, serum |  0.015  
LBXHCT |  Hydroxycotinine, serum |  0.015
