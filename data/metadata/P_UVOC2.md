### Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Metabolites II - Urine (P_UVOC2)

####  Data File: P_UVOC2.xpt

##### First Published: September 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from surplus urine samples from the NHANES 2017-2018
cycle to form a nationally representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic data. These data are available to the public. Please refer to the
Analytic Notes section for more details on the use of the data.

Assessing human benzene exposure is of public health significance. Exposure is
associated with leukemia and other numerous health risks (Bahadar et. al.,
2014; Smith, 2010), and people may be exposed to benzene from numerous
sources, including tobacco smoke (Smith, 2010; Talhout et. al., 2006),
e-cigarette aerosol (Behar et. al., 2018; Pankow et. al., 2017), automobile
exhaust, and industrial applications (Smith, 2010).

VOCs can be metabolized prior to urinary excretion, so VOC exposure can be
assessed by measuring their urine metabolites. An analytical method was
developed to measure metabolites of benzene (trans,trans-Muconic acid
[URXMUCA]; N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine [URXPHMA]), which will greatly improve
our understanding of the extent of exposure to these selected VOCs.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and participants aged 6 years and
older from a one-third subsample in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure to measure urinary metabolites of
benzene using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with
electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Sample
preparation involves 1:10 dilution of 50 µL urine samples in ammonium formate
buffer, pH 2.9. Chromatographic separation of each prepared urine specimen is
achieved by using a Waters Acquity UPLC HSS fluoro-phenyl (PFP) column using a
mobile phase A (0.02% formic acid) and a mobile phase B (methanol). The eluate
from the column is ionized using electrospray ionization, which is used to
generate and transmit ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative
response factors (ratio of native analyte to stable isotope-labeled internal
standard) with known standard concentrations yields individual analyte
concentrations in each sample (Bhandari et. al., 2019).

The VOC Metabolites II dataset was produced by applying an improved method for
measuring N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine (PHMA). NHANES cycle 2015-2016 and
prior measured PHMA (NHANES variable URXPMA, dataset UVOC_I) in urine samples
at neutral pH. Conversely, NHANES cycle 2017-March 2020 measured PHMA (NHANES
variable URXPHMA) in urine samples prepared at pH 2.9. This acid treatment
converts the PHMA precursor, i.e., pre-PHMA to PHMA; thus the new method
quantifies both free PHMA and PHMA formed from the acid dehydration of pre-
PHMA (Bhandari et. al., 2019). This new PHMA measure more accurately assesses
benzene exposure (Sterz et. al., 2010). The PHMA results reported from NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data (URXPHMA) should not be directly compared to
PHMA (URXPMA) reported in previous NHANES analyses (Tevis et. al., 2020).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals
(LPM). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they
are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the CDC and contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include
performing blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from surplus specimens from
the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data
file. A special weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in the present file should be
used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are
not appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not
yield nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or
the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for
additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and
for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that
2-year cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data
Overviews](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. Additionally, availability of specimens for surplus projects
is lower than for other laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The
specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)[
](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm)and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for details on the use of
sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample, WTVOC2PP, are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data. The sample
weights created for this file used the examination sample weight, i.e.,
WTMECPRP, as the base weight. The base weight was adjusted for additional
nonresponse to these lab tests and re-poststratified to the population total
using sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants who were part of the eligible
population but who did not provide a urine specimen, or did not have
sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their
specimens to be used for future research (for 2017-2018) are included in the
file but they have a sample weight assigned "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
"Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**  
  
The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDPMALC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDPMALC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXPHMA) provides the
analytic result for the analyte. All data are rounded to three significant
figures or three decimal places, whichever is less precise.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for URXMUCA and URXPHMA:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Name** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URXMUCA |  _trans, trans-_ Muconic acid (ng/mL) |  9.81  
URXPHMA |  Phenylmercapturic acid (ng/mL) |  0.150
