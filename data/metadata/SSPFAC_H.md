### Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in US children 3-11 Years of
Age (SSPFAC_H)

####  Data File: SSPFAC_H.xpt

##### First Published: August 2017

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (15-<20% of records) that were initially included
in error. No data values were altered. However, survey weights were adjusted.
For each analyte included in this data file, it was determined that overall
and for stratified sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin groups, the updated file
using the new sample weights resulted in an estimate within the 95% confidence
limit calculated using the original file and sample weights. However, not all
possible analyses were performed. For any queries related to this dataset
please email the Biospecimen Program at serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

Exposure data to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) among
the US general population 12 years of age and older have been included in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) since 1999-2000 (CDC
2015). However, general population data among children 3-11 years of age are
limited to those obtained from using pooled sera collected in NHANES 2001-2002
(Kato et al. 2009).  
  
Exposure data in children may impact health later in life and, therefore, are
of public health significance. However, data on general exposure to PFAS among
American children younger than 12 years do not exist in NHANES using
individual samples. To fill this exposure data gap, we measured fourteen PFAS
in one third subset of participants 3-11 years of age using surplus sera
collected for the measurement of cotinine as part of NHANES 2013-2014.  

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 3-11 years from NHANES 2013-2014 with stored serum.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Solid phase extraction coupled to High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Turbo
Ion Spray ionization-tandem Mass Spectrometry (online SPE-HPLC-TIS-MS/MS) is
used for the quantitative detection of 14 PFAS: perfluorooctane sulfonamide
(PFOSA), 2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),
2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Et-PFOSA-AcOH),
perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBuS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS),
perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate
(PFDeA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUA), perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA), linear
PFOA (n-PFOA), sum of branched isomers of PFOA (Sb-PFOA), linear PFOS
(n-PFOS), and sum of perfluoromethylheptane sulfonate isomers (Sm-PFOS).
Briefly, after dilution with formic acid, one aliquot of 50 Î¼L of serum is
injected into a commercial column switching system allowing for concentration
and chromatographic separation of the analytes. Detection and quantification
are done using tandem mass spectrometry (Kato, et al. 2011).  
  
Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.  
  
They were no changes to the lab equipment or lab site for this component
compared with those used for measuring PFAS in participants 12 years of age
and older in NHANES 2013-2014.  
  
To estimate the total (sum of the isomers measured) concentrations of PFOS and
PFOA for each participant, sum the concentrations of n-PFOA and Sb-PFOA for
PFOA, and those of n-PFOS and Sm-PFOS for PFOS. If the value of one isomer is
less than the limit of detection (LOD), then the imputed value is used. The
imputed value is calculated as the LOD divided by the square root of 2
(Hornung et al. 1990) and imputed values are provided in the NHANES public
release file. If the values of all isomers are reported as less than the LOD,
then the sum will be the sum of each imputed value.  

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The analytical measurements were conducted following strict quality
control/quality assurance CLIA guidelines. Along with the study samples, each
analytical run included high- and low-concentration quality control materials
(QCs) and serum blanks to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data. The
concentrations of the high-concentration QCs and the low-concentration QCs,
averaged to obtain one measurement of high-concentration QC and low-
concentration QC for each run, were evaluated using standard statistical
probability rules (Caudill et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all analyses were complete. The data were not edited.  
Data Access: All data are publicly available.  

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2013-2014 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.  
  
**Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/demo_h.htm) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.  
This laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data files using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).  
  
**Detection Limits**  
  
Detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each analyte.  
The variable name ending in "L" (ex., SSPFOAL) indicates whether the result
was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at
or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the
limit of detection. For analytes with results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., SSPFOAL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the results
field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt2).  
The other variable prefixed SS (ex., SSNPFOA) provides the analytic result for
each analyte.  
The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for the fourteen PFAS are:

**Variable Name** |  **SAS Label** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
SSPFSA |  Perfluorooctane sulfonamide (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSMPAH |  2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSEPAH |  2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSPFDE |  Pefluorodecanoic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSPFBS |  Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSPFHP |  Perfluoroheptanoic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSPFNA |  Perfluorononanoic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSPFUA |  Perfluoroundecanoic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSPFDO |  Perflurododecanoic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSPFHS |  Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSNPFOA |  Linear perfluorooctanoate (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSBPFOA |  Branched isomers of perfluorooctanoate (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSNPFOS |  Linear perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (ng/mL) |  0.10  
SSMPFOS |  Monomethyl branched isomers of PFOS (ng/mL) |  0.10  
  

**Subsample Weights**

Sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data. Previous versions of this data file included a
sample weight variable (WTSS2YR) but when observations were removed from this
data file, a new sample weight was created, and a new sample weight variable
was added to this data file (WTSSPH2Y). Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
