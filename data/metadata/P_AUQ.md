# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2017-March 2020 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Audiometry (P_AUQ)

####  Data File: P_AUQ.xpt

##### First Published: September 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Topics included in the Audiometry questionnaire data file (P_AUQ) are:

  * Self-assessed condition of hearing; 
  * The Gallaudet hearing scale for self-reported hearing loss; 
  * Impact of hearing ability on daily life; 
  * Onset and cause of any self-reported hearing trouble; 
  * History of ear infections; ear tube placed for infection; 
  * History of speech-language or special education services; 
  * How recently hearing tests were performed, if ever; 
  * Hearing aid use and cochlear implant status; 
  * Use of assistive listening devices; 
  * 12-month period prevalence of tinnitus: how long bothered by tinnitus, tinnitus present after loud sounds, bothered by tinnitus when falling asleep, self-assessed severity of tinnitus; 
  * History of exposure to firearms noise, occupational and/or non-occupational loud noise; and use of hearing protection. 

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants aged 1 year and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample are included in this dataset. The initial question
(AUQ054) was for all participants aged 1 years and older. The rest of the
questions were for participants aged 6-19 and 70 years and older. Please
review the target age group for each variable in the codebook.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Hand cards showing
response categories were also used for some questions. When necessary,
household interviewers read the hand cards to survey participants.
Participants 16 years of age and older and emancipated minors were interviewed
directly. A proxy provided information for survey participants who were under
16 years of age and for participants who could not answer the questions
themselves.

The NHANES 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 audiometry questionnaires are available on
the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, &ldquo;skip&rdquo; patterns were verified, and
the reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. All information
collected in the audiometry questionnaire section is released to the public,
except for the other cause of hearing loss specified in a text entry field
(AUQ410OS). All other causes were reviewed, and some were assigned to
appropriate causes of hearing loss variables (AUQ410a--AUQ410i). As the nature
of self-reported data, the responses to some questions reflect the
participants&rsquo; knowledge and may not be reasonable for a few cases.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data was collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in the
2019-2020 sample. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not
nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the
previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. The sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

The analysis of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic audiometry questionnaire
data must be conducted using the appropriate survey design variables, sample
weights, and the basic demographic variables. Interview weights should only be
used if questionnaire data are analyzed by themselves. However, if AUQ data
are merged with the MEC examination data (for example the Audiometry
examination or laboratory data), the MEC examination weights should be used
for analyses.

When combining AUQ data from different survey cycles, please note that there
are target age changes and question changes (add, drop, and modify) between
survey cycles. Please see the questionnaire and read the documentation for
each survey cycle before analyzing AUQ data from different survey cycles.

Other related datasets, including Audiometry, Tympanometry, Wideband
Absorbance, and Acoustic Reflex examination data for NHANES participants are
available in the Audiometry section of the Examination data files.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
