### Flame Retardants - Urine (FR_J)

####  Data File: FR_J.xpt

##### First Published: March 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Flame retardants (FRs) are either additive or reactive ingredients applied to
household and consumer products to reduce the products flammability, and to
meet state and federal fire safety standards and regulations. Until recently,
a dominant class of FR additives used for household products was
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are persistent and can
accumulate in the environment (de Wit 2002; Law et al.2006, Stapleton et al.
2012). Flame retardant formulations containing chlorinated and non-chlorinated
organophosphates and non-PBDE brominated chemicals have entered consumers'
markets as PBDEs have been phased-out in many countries (van der Veen and de
Boer 2012). Some of these compounds used in flame retardant formulations are:
triphenyl phosphate, tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate,
tris(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, tri-cresyl
phosphates, tributyl phosphate, tribenzyl phosphate, and
2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate. NHANES recently developed a method to
measure the metabolites of these compounds, which can be used as exposure
biomarkers: diphenyl phosphate, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate),
bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate, bis-2-chloroethyl phosphate, dibutyl
phosphate, and 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic acid.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible, and participants
aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The method uses 0.2 mL urine and is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of urinary
conjugates of the target analytes, automated off-line solid phase extraction,
reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography separation, and isotope
dilution-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection
(Jayatilaka et al. 2019).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the NHANES 2017-2018 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Flame Retardants-Urine Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/FR-J-
MET-508.pdf) (March 2022)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they were
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary flame retardants were measured in a full sample of participants aged
3-5 and a one third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special
sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data.

The analytes included in this dataset were measured for all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. For participants aged 3-5, their WTSB2YR are equivalent to
their MEC exam sample weights. These participants have completed at least one
physical exam component in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample
weight larger than "0," regardless of their lab test results. For participants
6 years and older, special sample weights were created for the subsample.
These special weights accounted for the additional probability of selection
into the subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if participants 6 years and older were selected as part of the one-
third subsample, but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the
sample weight value assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-2018 Demographic
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDCNPLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDCNPLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXCNP) provides the
analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for urinary flame retardants:

VARIABLE NAME | ANALYTE DESCRIPTION | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URXBCPP | Bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXBCEP | Bis-2-chloroethyl phosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXBDCP | Bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXDBUP | Dibutyl phosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXDPHP | Diphenyl phosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXTBBA | 2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoic acid (ng/mL) | 0.05
