### Medical Conditions (MCQ_I)

####  Data File: MCQ_I.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2017

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The medical conditions section (variable name prefix MCQ) provides self- and
proxy-reported personal interview data on a broad range of health conditions
and medical history for both children and adults. The NHANES MCQ questionnaire
section is generally modeled on the "Medical Conditions" questionnaire section
of the U.S. National Health Interview Survey.

**Major Topics in the MCQ Section:**  
Asthma, Childhood and Adult  
Hay fever  
Anemia  
Overweight  
Blood transfusions  
Menses onset  
Arthritis  
Gout  
Heart diseases (i.e., congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease,
angina, and heart attack)  
Stroke  
Lung diseases (i.e., chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease)  
Thyroid problems  
Liver disease  
Jaundice  
Cancer (multiple varieties)  
History of internal metal objects  

Additional topics covered in this section include family history of select
health conditions (asthma, heart attack/angina, and diabetes) and lifestyle
modifications to reduce disease.

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for questions in this section varies by age and gender.
Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency counts were
verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. The survey questionnaire
is available on the [NHANES
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed and edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical
values.

## Analytic Notes

A number of additional questions occur in MCQ that are logically related to
other questionnaire sections or exam segments. Analysts should refer to these
other NHANES sections as part of any data analysis.

Although these data were collected as part of the household questionnaire, if
they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used for
the analyses.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
online [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
