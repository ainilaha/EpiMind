### Fluorosis - Clinical (FLXCLN_F)

####  Data File: FLXCLN_F.xpt

##### First Published: March 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Dental fluorosis clinical assessment was included in the NHANES oral health
examination to monitor fluorosis in the population for selected age groups.
Fluoride exposure, from any source, during the period of tooth development
(birth to 6 years) is associated with increased risk of developing dental (or
enamel) fluorosis. Dental fluorosis is characterized by an increasing porosity
or hypomineralization of the tooth enamel that leads to visual changes of the
enamel that appear once a tooth erupts (Dean, 1934; Fejerskov et al., 1990).
Most permanent teeth, except third molars, develop during the first 6-8 years
of life. The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the dose and duration of
fluoride ingestion during tooth development (Dean, 1942; Fejerskov et al.,
1990).

In the United States, dental fluorosis is generally considered a cosmetic
effect with no negative functional effect (Kaminsky et al., 1990; Fluoride
Recommendation Work Group, 2001; US Department of Health and Human Services,
2015). The severe form of dental fluorosis, however, may have adverse dental
effects because the pitting can compromise the protective function of the
enamel and the affected area can break away (Clark and Slayton, 2014;
Fejerskov et al., 1990; National Research Council, 2006; US Department of
Health and Human Services, 2015). But the severe form is rare in the U.S.
(Beltran-Aguilar et al., 2010; National Research Council, 2006).

## Eligible Sample

A dental fluorosis clinical assessment was conducted on survey participants
aged 6-19 years who received the Oral Health Examination (exam status code,
OHDEXSTS, is complete or partial).

## Protocol and Procedure

The dental fluorosis clinical assessment was conducted at the NHANES mobile
examination center (MEC) by dental examiners, who were registered dental
hygienists licensed in at least one U.S. state. The dental hygienists were
trained by a licensed dentist with expertise in conducting dental surveys,
following procedures similar to those used during NHANES 1999-2004. Similar
training procedures were also used in NHANES 2011-2016.

A health technician entered examiner observations directly into a computerized
data collection system at the MEC. Examiners used a dental mirror for the
assessment. Teeth were not dried with air before assessment.

Unlike the dental clinical fluorosis assessment protocols used in 1999-2004
and 2011-2016, which examined all surfaces of all teeth except third molars,
only the facial surfaces of fully erupted, permanent, maxillary anterior teeth
(teeth number 6-11) were evaluated in NHANES 2009-2010. The dental fluorosis
clinical assessment proceeded in a tooth by tooth manner, similar to the tooth
count assessment, beginning with the maxillary right central incisor and
proceeding posteriorly to the upper right cuspid. Then, the same sequence was
repeated for the upper left side. The examiner observed the enamel condition
of the corresponding bilateral tooth. For example, if initially examining
tooth #6, then #11 is the examined bilateral tooth.

Each tooth was scored according to the Dean's Fluorosis Index (DFI) and
assigned one of the DFI disease severity categories (Table 1), based on the
area of the tooth surface with visible fluorosis and presence of pitting:
normal (DFI=0), questionable (5), very mild (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or
severe (4) (Dean, 1934; Dean, 1942). Missing teeth, deciduous (primary) teeth,
permanent teeth not fully erupted, and teeth in which more than one-half of
the visible surface area was obscured by a restoration, caries, or orthodontic
appliance were not assessed. These teeth were coded as 9 "cannot be assessed".
A tooth having a non-fluoride opacity was coded as 8. The NHANES [Oral Health
Examiners
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/OralHealth_Examiners.pdf)
provides detail on assessing a tooth for fluorosis.



**Table 1.** Dean's Fluorosis Index (DFI) criteria and scoring on the NHANES
dental fluorosis clinical assessment

NHANES DFI Value  |  Fluorosis Severity Level  |  Description   
---|---|---  
0 | Normal | No fluorosis detected  
1 | Very mild | Opaque, paperwhite areas involving less than ¼ of the tooth surface  
2 | Mild | Opaque, paperwhite areas involving ¼ to less than ½ of the tooth surface  
3 | Moderate | Opaque paperwhite areas involving ½ or more of the tooth surface  
4 | Severe | Discrete or confluent pitting in involved areas  
5 | Questionable | Slight aberration of normal enamel appearance, including white flecks  
8 | Non-fluoride opacity | Coded if non-fluoride opacity  
9 | Cannot be assessed | Coded if the tooth was missing, not fully erupted, one-half or more of the tooth was replaced with a restoration, covered with orthodontic band, or destroyed by caries.  
  
## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The specific quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) practices for the
dental fluorosis clinical assessment are documented in detail in the NHANES
[Oral Health Examiners
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013-14_Oral_Health_Recorders_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

All dental examiners received an initial training that consisted of lecture,
practice simulations, and standardization sessions using projected images.
Following initial training, examiners received field training at the MEC
consisting of more practice simulations, standardizations, and calibration
sessions with NHANES survey participants.

During data collection, the reference examiner visited each dental examiner
2-3 times a year to conduct a random number of replicate examinations during
each visit. The reference examiner determined if retraining and future
monitoring of the dental examiner was needed. The reference examiner also
conducted an annual retraining session for all dental examiners to reinforce
existing protocols and to introduce protocol updates as needed.

Since 1999, data for the oral health examination have been recorded directly
onto a computerized data collection system at the MEC. The system is
integrated centrally and allows for ongoing monitoring of much of the data. As
part of the quality control practice, all data are reviewed systematically for
logical inconsistencies. Before data release, the collected data are further
reviewed.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data files are produced with the teeth numbered using the Universal or ADA
Dental Numbering System for teeth numbers 6-11.

## Analytic Notes

NHANES is the only survey providing national estimates on dental fluorosis.
Two-year estimates of fluorosis prevalence by DFI category demonstrated
variability within and across multiple-year time periods. To assess the data
quality of the clinical dental fluorosis examination, a review was conducted
on the NHANES 1999-2004 and 2011-2016 data. The report is available at the
[NCHS website
](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/series/series02.htm)(National Center for
Health Statistics and National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion, 2019). The 2009-2010 data were not included in this
evaluation report because of key differences with fluorosis assessment in
2009-2010 compared with the other years: dental hygienists conducted the
assessment and only the facial surfaces of the maxillary anterior teeth were
evaluated. However, the findings and the quality assessment principles used in
this report should be strongly considered when determining whether these data
are appropriate for the user's analytic objectives, including studies of
prevalence and trends.

**DATA EVALUATION OF 2009-2010 FLUOROSIS CLINICAL ASSESSMENT DATA**

As described previously in the review of the 1999-2004 and 2011-2016 clinical
dental fluorosis examination data report, several QA processes were
implemented to evaluate these data. These QA processes were applied to the
2009-2010 data along with additional evaluations of rater variability and
reliability. Below are summaries of the findings that were assessed on the
final data.

For these analyses, each participant was assigned a dental fluorosis severity
value based on the lesser of the two most affected tooth-level DFI values
among the six upper anterior teeth. For all analyses, tooth-level DFI value of
cannot be assessed (code 9) and non-fluoride opacity (code 8) were recoded to
missing. The questionable category, which was recorded during data collection
as 5, was recoded to 0.5. This is consistent with Dean's assignment of values,
and reflects a questionable value falling between normal and very mild, in
terms of severity. Only youth with at least two teeth with a non-missing DFI
value (i.e., 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4) were assigned a person-level DFI and
included in further analyses.

In 2009-2010, 67.3% of youth aged 6-11 years and 90.6% of youth aged 12-19
years had at least two upper anterior teeth with a non-missing DFI value. The
percentages of missing DFI value are similar to other survey cycles for youth
6-11 years (Table 2). Comparing to youth aged 6-11 years, youth aged 12-19
years had a lower percentage of missing DFI value. This is consistent with
data from other survey cycles as well. However, youth aged 12-19 years in
2009-2010 had slightly higher percentage with missing DFI scoring, compared to
youth aged 12-19 years from 2011-2016 cycles.

**Inter-Examiner Reliability: Evaluation of Gold Standard Examinations from
2009-2010**

In 2009-2010, gold standard examinations were conducted by a reference
examiner on 3.7% (n=76) of participants aged 6-19 years who completed the
dental fluorosis assessment. Complete data for analysis (i.e., at least two
upper anterior teeth with valid DFI values from both examiner and reference)
were available for 72 participants. To assess inter-examiner reliability, we
calculated percent agreement and kappa statistics comparing person-level DFI
values computed by the reference examiner and the dental examiner for the same
participant. In addition, weighted kappa statistics were computed using
different weighting schemes to describe various levels of disagreement between
dental examiner and reference examiner on the DFI scale (i.e., difference in
one category, two categories, etc.). Survey examination weights were not used
in these analyses.

The unweighted kappa (Cohen et al. 1960) assigns a weight of 1 for perfect
agreement (e.g., examiner DFI = 1 and reference DFI =1) and 0 for no agreement
(e.g., examiner DFI = 1 and reference DFI =2); Custom #1 weights assigned 1
for perfect agreement, 0.667 for 1 category difference, 0.333 for a 2 category
difference, and 0 for a difference of more than 2 categories; Custom #2 (based
on Kumar et al., 2000) assigned 1 for perfect agreement, 0.5 for 1 category
difference, and 0 for all others; the other two weighting schemes were based
on Cicchetti and Allison (1971) and Fleiss and Cohen (1973). Qualitative
interpretation of numeric kappa statistic value ranges are: less than chance
agreement (<0), slight agreement (0.00-0.20), fair agreement (0.21-0.40),
moderate agreement (0.41-0.60), substantial agreement (0.61-0.80), and almost
perfect (0.81-0.99) (Landis and Koch, 1977). Kappa <0.60 may also be used as a
general indicator of inadequate agreement among raters (McHugh, 2012).

Unweighted kappa values for the three dental examiners who conducted fluorosis
assessments in 2009-2010 ranged from 0.48 to 0.65 (Table 3). When considering
the results across all four weighting schemes, the agreement between the
dental examiners and reference examiner ranged from 0.26 through 0.92. These
reliability statistics would be considered fair to almost perfect agreement
based on the Landis and Koch interpretation of kappa values. When McHugh's
requirement of a kappa value of at least 0.60 for adequate agreement is
applied, the majority of the kappa values indicate adequate agreement (i.e.,
11 out of 15 kappa values computed for 3 examiners were at or above 0.60).

In general, the percent agreement and kappa statistics between dental
examiners and reference examiner in 2009-2010 are comparable to those in
1999-2004 and 2011-2016 cycles, based on assessments using only 6 upper
anterior teeth (Table 3). As mentioned in the above Protocol and Procedure
session, the NHANES 2009-2010 fluorosis clinical assessments were conducted by
dental hygienists. This is different from the NHANES 1999-2004 and 2011-2016
protocol, in which the assessments were conducted by dentists. However,
similar training procedures were used throughout these time periods for both
dentists in 1999-2004 and 2011-2016, as well as dental hygienists in
2009-2010. Results from the kappa statistics supported the comparability
between the two type of examiners. Although given the current state dental
practice law, dental hygienists are usually not allowed to diagnose dental
fluorosis. Data users should take the additional training and the surveillance
nature of NHANES into account.

NOTE: All kappa statistics were computed using the following Dean's Fluorosis
Index values: 0 = Normal, 0.5 = Questionable (recoded from collected value of
5), 1 = Very mild; 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Severe. All values of 8 (non-
fluoride opacity) and 9 (could not assess) were set to missing.

**Prevalence of Dental Fluorosis Severity of Six Anterior Teeth Among Youth**

Weighted 2-year and 6-year estimates of dental fluorosis severity were
computed on children 6-19 years (the common age range across all years) who
had at least 2 upper anterior teeth with a non-missing DFI value (1999-2004,
n=9,395; 2009-2010, n=2,010, 2011-2016, n=7,158). Examination sample weights
were used in these analyses.

In 2009-2010, 31.7% (SE=2.9) of youth 6-19 years were estimated to have very
mild fluorosis, 19.3% (SE=3.0) mild, 1;6% (SE=0.2) moderate, and 0.4% (SE=0.1)
severe (Table 4).

Variability in the prevalence of different dental fluorosis severity levels
was seen in the 2-year and six-year estimates across time periods. The 2-year
estimated percentage of youth 6-19 years with very mild fluorosis was ranged
from 15.7% to 31.7%, and ranged from 2.2% to 19.3% for mild, 0.6% to 5.9% for
moderate, and 0.0% to 0.8% for severe fluorosis. The six-year estimates from
1999-2004 and 2011-2016 were 18.0% and 23.2% for very mild, 3.4% and 8.5% for
mild, 1.4% and 3.8% for moderate, and 0.2% and 0.3% for severe fluorosis
(Table 4), respectively. The observed variability may be partially explained
by youth missing teeth that could not be assessed. The eruption patterns of
children are such that the permanent central incisors may be present and
assessed; whereas, the other permanent teeth may not be fully erupted yet,
especially among youth aged 6-11 years.

Assessing the percentage of dental fluorosis using the six anterior teeth has
certain limitations (Akinkugbe et al., 2014; Medina-Solis et al., 2008).
Comparing to estimates that use 28 teeth, prevalence could be underestimated
and estimates less stable when only six teeth were used. The limitations of
six teeth are further compounded when using the DFI for defining fluorosis
since two assessed teeth are a requirement and youth aged 6-11 years are less
likely to have 2 fully erupted permanent teeth for assessment. As shown in
above Table 2, only 67.3% of youth 6-11 years in the 2009-2010 sample
satisfied this requirement. While these facial surfaces are easily accessible
to direct visual inspection, using the upper six-anterior teeth may
underestimate the prevalence and severity of fluorosis because late forming
teeth are not included in the estimates. For instance, prior study has
indicated that the lack of second permanent premolars and molars in the
assessment could explain the lower prevalence of fluorosis observed among
youth 6-11 years compared to youth aged 12-15 years (Beltran-Aguilar et al.,
2005). In addition, previous studies also suggested that the prevalence and
severity of dental fluorosis may vary by birth cohort (Beltran-Aguilar et al.,
2002; Beltran-Aguilar et al., 2005). Therefore, estimated changes over time
should consider to be age-adjusted or limit the number of years included in
the age group for the analysis.

**2009-2010 DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT SUMMARY**

There are potential sources of error in the measurement of fluorosis in
general, and specifically in sample surveys, such as NHANES. While these
potential sources of error exist, the inter-examiner reliability statistics
and variability of prevalence of different dental fluorosis severity are seen
across the cycles of dental fluorosis clinical assessments (i.e., 1999-2004,
2009-2010, and 2011-2016). Additionally, it is important to note the
limitations of assessing only six permanent upper anterior teeth rather than
28 among youth who may have a higher proportion of missing or primary teeth
and the implication of this when using the lesser of two DFI values to define
dental fluorosis.
