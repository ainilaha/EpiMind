### Pregnancy Test - Urine (UC)

####  Data File: UC.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2002

#####  Last Revised: January 2007

## Component Description

The urine pregnancy test was performed for females of ages 12-59 in 1999 and
8-59 in 2000. If the urine test results were positive for pregnancy, a serum
pregnancy test was also performed.

## Eligible Sample

The data file released to the public included female participants of ages 18
to 59 years old. Participants of ages 17 and younger were not included in the
public data file because of confidentiality constrains.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The Iconr 25 hCG (Urine/Serum) test kit is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay
for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine
or serum to aid in the early detection of pregnancy. The test utilizes a
combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively detect
elevated levels of hCG in urine or serum.

## Data Processing and Editing

Urine and serum specimens were tested in the NHANES mobile examination
centers. Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are
discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.
