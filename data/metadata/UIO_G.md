### Iodine - Urine (UIO_G)

####  Data File: UIO_G.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2013

#####  Last Revised: October 2014

## Component Description

Iodine, an essential element for thyroid function, is necessary for normal
growth, development, and functioning of the brain and body. Iodine-deficiency
disorder (IDD) is a well documented global health problem, affecting more than
a billion people worldwide. Consequences of IDD include goiter, cretinism,
intellectual impairment, brain damage, mental retardation, stillbirth,
congenital deformities, and increased perinatal mortality. Progress toward
eliminating IDDs has been substantial; an estimated 70% of the world's edible
salt currently is iodized. Most excess iodine is excreted, and most people can
tolerate fairly large amounts without experiencing problems. People with a
tendency toward autoimmune thyroid disease are less tolerant of excess iodine.
If a person has previously been iodine-deficient, that person may be at risk
for iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Excessive iodine intake by a mother can
pose a reproductive risk. Since urinary iodine values directly reflect dietary
iodine intake, urinary iodine analysis is the recommended and most common
method for biochemically assessing the iodine status of a population. This
method achieves rapid and accurate quantification of iodine content in urine.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

Urine iodine concentrations are determined by ICP-DRC-MS (Inductively Coupled
Plasma Dynamic Reaction Cell Mass Spectroscopy). This multielement analytical
technique is based on quadrupole ICP-MS technology and includes DRC™
technology. Coupling radio frequency power into a flowing argon stream seeded
with electrons creates the plasma, the heat source, which is ionized gas
suspended in a magnetic field. Predominant species in the plasma are positive
argon ions and electrons. Diluted urine samples are converted into an aerosol
using a nebulizer inserted within the spray chamber. A portion of the aerosol
is transported through the spray chamber and then through the central channel
of the plasma, where it is exposed to temperatures of 6000-8000 ºK. This
thermal energy atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter
the mass spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is
operating at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass
spectrometer, which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr. The mass
spectrometer permits detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio in rapid
sequence, which allows the determination of individual isotopes of an element.
Once inside the mass spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion optics, then
through DRC™, and finally through the mass-analyzing quadrupole, before being
detected as they strike the surface of the detector. The ion optics uses an
electrical field to focus the ion beam into the DRC™. The DRC™ component is
pressurized with an appropriate reaction gas and contains a quadrupole.
Electrical signals resulting from the detection of the ions are processed into
digital information that is used to indicate the intensity of the ions and
subsequently the concentration of the element. Traditionally ICP-MS has been a
trace analysis technique and the typical measurement ranges from < 0.1 µg/L to
around 100 µg/L. DRC technology provides additional control of ICP-MS
sensitivity; therefore appropriate adjustments of the reaction cell parameters
can significantly extend the useful concentration measurement range. In this
method, iodine (isotope mass 127), tellurium (isotope mass 130), mercury
(isotope mass 202) and bismuth (isotope mass 209) are measured in urine by
ICP-DRC-MS using 100% argon as the Dynamic Reaction Cell™ (DRC) gas utilizing
collisional focusing. Urine samples are diluted 1+1+ 8 (sample+ water +
diluent) with water and diluent containing tellurium and bismuth for internal
standardization

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods, or lab site.

Refer to NHANES 2011-2012 [Lab Methods for Iodine &
Mercury](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/labmethods/uiouhg_g_met_iodine_mercury.pdf)
for detailed description of the laboratory method used.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample weights  
**Urinary iodine were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6 years and
older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation  
**The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
