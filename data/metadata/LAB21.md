# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 1999-2000 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) - Personal Exposure Badge (LAB21)

####  Data File: LAB21.xpt

#####  First Published: April 2005

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Nearly 200 toxic air contaminants have been associated with adverse health
effects in occupational studies or laboratory studies, but have not been
monitored in general population groups. Information on levels of exposure to
these compounds is essential to determine the need for regulatory mechanisms
to reduce the levels of hazardous air pollutants to which the general
population is exposed.

In this component, personal exposure to air toxics (specifically, volatile
organic compounds, or VOCs) were assessed through the use of passive exposure
monitors (or badges) worn by participants for a period of 48-72 hours. The
following 10 VOCs were measured in the personal exposure badges: benzene,
chloroform, ethylbenzene, tetrachloroethene, toluene, trichloroethene,
o-xylene, m-,p-xylene, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and methyl tert-butyl ether
(MTBE).

Participants began wearing the exposure monitors when they left the mobile
examination center (MEC) after completing an examination and returned the
badges 48-72 hours later, either at the MEC or the field office. During the
return visit, a short questionnaire was administered to participants to assess
personal activities and exposures related to VOC measures. The questionnaire
data are included in this file.

## Eligible Sample

For the survey years, the eligible sample was as follows: in 1999, there was a
one-fourth subsample of persons 20-59 years; in 2000, there was a one-third
subsample of persons 20-59 years. There were no component-specific exclusions.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Two different laboratories assessed VOCs in exposure monitors.

**Lab 1**

A selected group of VOCs in vapor form are measured by a modification of
Method 7 of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the U.
S. Dept. of Labor (1). The method has been modified to use 3M 3520 Organic
Vapor Monitors (OVM) (manufactured without glued-on labels) as the sampling
media and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as the detection device
(2). Sampling times have been extended for additional sensitivity. The vapors
are quantified by desorption from the collection media with a solution of
carbon disulfide and acetone, and identified and measured against a standard
curve on the GC/MS. The GC/MS is operated in the selected-ion-monitoring mode
(SIM) for additional sensitivity.

**Lab 2**

Analysis is performed using an HP 5890 Series II Plus GC (Gas Chromatograph)
with an HP 5972 MSD (Mass Selective Detector Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer) and
EnviroQuant software. We initially used a Restek RTX-1, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID
column and a 1-Âµm film thickness (catalog #10156; Restek Corp., Bellefonte,
PA) with good separation for all target analytes. More recently, we have been
using a Restek RTX B624, 60 m, 0.25 mm ID with 1.4-Âµm thickness column
(catalog # 10969), which provides even better resolution for separation of the
solvent peaks and methylene chloride. With the last column, the gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) conditions are:

  * scan mode from 35 to 260 amu. 
  * injection splitless for 0.5 min and splitting 50:1 for the rest of the run. 
  * helium carrier; initial pressure 3 psi for 0.5 min, ramp 90 psi/min to 22.5 psi; linear velocity 31.1 cm/sec. 
  * injection port temperature 180Â°C. 
  * detector temperature 250Â°C. 
  * temperature program: start at 40Â°C, hold for 12 min, ramp at 8Â°C/min to 200Â°C. 

**Survey Staff**

The NHANES 1999â2000 laboratory staff consists of medical technologists and
phlebotomists. The medical technologists hold baccalaureates in medical
technology. The American Society for Clinical Pathologists or a similar
organization certifies the medical technologists and the phlebotomists. All
laboratory staff complete comprehensive training in standardized laboratory
procedures before they begin working in the MEC.

**Data Collection Forms**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Each chapter
in the LPM specifies the procedure to be used for preparation of the
participant, specimen collection, labeling, processing, and preservation, and
conditions for specimen transport that are appropriate for that method.

## Data Processing and Editing

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES
1999-2000\. In the mobile examination centers (MECs) and analytical
laboratories, data for the laboratory component is recorded directly onto a
computerized data collection form. The system is centrally integrated and it
allows for ongoing monitoring of much of the data. While the complete blood
count and pregnancy analyses are performed in the MEC laboratory, most
analyses are conducted elsewhere by 21 laboratories across the United States.

Guidelines have been developed that provide standards for naming variables,
filling missing values, and handling missing records. NCHS staff, assisted by
contract staff, have developed data-editing specifications that check data
sets for valid codes, ranges, and skip pattern consistencies and examine the
consistency of values between interrelated variables. Comments have been
reviewed and recoded. NCHS staff verifies extremely high and low values
whenever possible, and numerous consistency checks are performed. Nonetheless,
users should examine the range and frequency of values before analyzing data.

The data editing specifications are as follows:

  * Age and gender checks; 
  * Total number of observations complete for each field; 
  * No field overlap, truncated values, or weird results; 
  * Direct data entry (DDE) errors; 
  * Abnormal results confirmed by lab; 
  * Test algorithm performed; 
  * Checked comment codes to resolve missing results and missing records; 
  * All missing results and missing MEC-examined records are accounted; 
  * Duplicate records were verified and deleted; and 
  * Below detection limit formula was applied. 

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

**MECs**

Laboratory team performance is monitored by using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance (QA) evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control (QC) procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation, and testing
procedures, and constructive feedback is given to each staff member. Formal
retraining sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill
levels are maintained.

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols meet the 1988
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control and
quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
second examinations on previously examined participants and blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories outlining the Westgaard rules used when running NHANES specimens.
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are periodically reviewed for trends
or shifts in the data, and the laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern. NCHS/Westat are currently reviewing these
reports.

The comparability of the measures between the two laboratories was evaluated
through review by an expert panel.



## Analytic Notes

The values for the analytes are expressed as the weight of the analyte per
cubic meter. The number of cubic meters is derived from the period of time the
exposure monitor was used. The variable LBAVOCSD indicates the number of hours
the monitor was used.

Detection limits varied by time period for these analytes. A derived variable
for each analyte, LBD_LC, was created to indicate those results that were
below the limit of detection. Detection limits were standardized for 48-hour
sample duration. If the result was below the limit of detection, the value
provided for the analyte is the detection limit adjusted for the actual
duration the badge was exposed (LBAVOCSD) divided by the square root of 2.

**Special Notes about this Dataset**

Measures for this component were assessed in a randomly selected subsample of
participants aged 12-59 years. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

The dataset includes 2-year subsample weights. The recommended procedure for
variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and
SDMVPSU, respectively), which are included in the demographic data file for
each data release. For further information, see the NHANES Analytic
Guidelines, June 2004 version at:
https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_general_guidelines_june_04.pdf .
