### Measles, Mumps, Rubella & Varicella (MMRV_F)

####  Data File: MMRV_F.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2011

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Susceptibility to measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) for the
purpose of monitoring the susceptibility of the U.S. population to each of
these highly contagious, infectious diseases. Serological testing for
antibodies for MMRV among NHANES participants has been a primary means for
determining the impact of the vaccination program in the U.S. and would serve
to document progress toward achieving the Healthy People 2010 goals related to
all four of these diseases. In addition, documenting trends in immunity is
necessary to estimate duration of protection in the US population.
Documentation of waning immunity in a population with high vaccination
coverage and low probability of boosting due to exposure to wild virus will
have implications on future vaccination policy in the US.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 6 to 49 years are eligible to be tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the National Center for
Immunization and Respiratory Disease Laboratories. Detailed specimen
collection and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM.)\

**Measles antibody**

The Wampole Measles IgG ELISA test system is designed to detect IgG class
antibodies to Measles virus in human sera. Wells of plastic microwell strips
are sensitized by passive absorption with antigen. The test procedure involves
three incubation steps: 1) test sera (properly diluted) are incubated in
antigen coated microwells. Any antigen specific antibody in the sample will
bind to the immobilized antigen. The plate is washed to remove unbound
antibody and other serum components, 2) peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human
IgG (y chain specific) is added to the wells and the plate is incubated. The
conjugate will react with Measles antibody immobilized on the solid phase in
step 1. The wells are washed to remove unreacted conjugate, 3) the microwells
containing immobilized peroxidase conjugate are incubated with peroxidase
substrate solution. Hydrolysis of the substrate by peroxidase produces a color
change. After a period of time the reaction is stopped and the color intensity
of the solution is measured photometrically. The color intensity of the
solution depends upon the antibody concentration in the original test sample.

**Mumps antibody**

The Wampole Mumps IgG ELISA test system is designed to detect IgG class
antibodies to Mumps virus in human sera. Wells of plastic microwell strips are
sensitized by passive absorption with antigen. The test procedure involves
three incubation steps: 1) test sera (properly diluted) are incubated in
antigen coated microwells. Any antigen specific antibody in the sample will
bind to the immobilized antigen. The plate is washed to remove unbound
antibody and other serum components, 2) peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human
IgG (y chain specific) is added to the wells and the plate is incubated. The
conjugate will react with Mumps antibody immobilized on the solid phase in
step 1. The wells are washed to remove unreacted conjugate, 3) the microwells
containing immobilized peroxidase conjugate are incubated with peroxidase
substrate solution. Hydrolysis of the substrate by peroxidase produces a color
change. After a period of time the reaction is stopped and the color intensity
of the solution is measured photometrically. The color intensity of the
solution depends upon the antibody concentration in the original test sample.

**Rubella antibody**

The Wampole Rubella IgG ELISA test system is designed to detect IgG class
antibodies to Rubella virus in human sera. Wells of plastic microwell strips
are sensitized by passive absorption with antigen. The test procedure involves
three incubation steps: 1) test sera (properly diluted) are incubated in
antigen coated microwells. Any antigen specific antibody in the sample will
bind to the immobilized antigen. The plate is washed to remove unbound
antibody and other serum components, 2) peroxidase conjugated goat anti-human
IgG (y chain specific) is added to the wells and the plate is incubated. The
conjugate will react with Rubella antibody immobilized on the solid phase in
step 1. The wells are washed to remove unreacted conjugate, 3) the microwells
containing immobilized peroxidase conjugate are incubated with peroxidase
substrate solution. Hydrolysis of the substrate by peroxidase produces a color
change. After a period of time the reaction is stopped and the color intensity
of the solution is measured photometrically. The color intensity of the
solution depends upon the antibody concentration in the original test sample.

**Varicella antibody**

Varicella-zoster virus IgG antibody in serum -- gpELISA  
The presence of IgG antibody to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is measured using
an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) developed by the staff of the National VZV
Laboratory (NCID/DVRD/VEHB). This method has been validated against a number
of other laboratory-based VZV serologic methods and performs comparably to all
of them (manuscript in preparation). Lentil-lectin-purified glycoprotein
antigens derived from VZV-infected human fibroblast cells (obtained through
CRADA with Merck & Co.) is coated on the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate,
which is subsequently incubated with a diluted test specimen. Control (normal
tissue) antigen (also obtained from Merck & Co.) is also prepared from
uninfected fibroblasts and is plated separately into different wells and
incubated with test serum to account for any nonspecific antibody reactivity.
After unbound serum components are removed by washing, an antibody-enzyme
conjugate, consisting of anti-human IgG antibody coupled to alkaline
phosphatase, is added to wells and incubated. The conjugate binds only to
human IgG antibodies that are in turn bound to the antigen coated on the
plates. A colorimetric substrate for the enzyme is added to the wells and
incubated for a sufficient time to permit color development, at which point
the reaction is stopped chemically. The enzyme-substrate reaction results in a
yellow-colored product that can be measured using a spectrophotometer set to a
wavelength of 405 nm. gpELISA has been demonstrated to have both higher
sensitivity and specificity than whole cell ELISA; since the antigens are
available in limited supply, however, it is used to test all specimens that
test in the negative or equivocal range by whole cell ELISA and to detect
seroconversion to vaccine (which requires the higher sensitivity).  
  
Varicella-zoster virus IgG antibody in serum - Whole Cell ELISA  
The presence of IgG antibody to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is measured using
an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) developed by the staff of the National VZV
Laboratory (NCID/DVRD/VEHB). This method has been validated against a number
of other laboratory-based VZV serologic methods and performs comparably to all
of them (manuscript in preparation). Detergent-extracted antigen derived from
VZV-infected human fibroblast cells is coated on the wells of a 96-well
microtiter plate, which is subsequently incubated with a diluted test
specimen. Control (normal tissue) antigen is also prepared from uninfected
fibroblasts and is plated separately into different wells and incubated with
test serum to account for any nonspecific antibody reactivity. After unbound
serum components are removed by washing, an antibody-enzyme conjugate,
consisting of anti-human IgG antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase, is
added to wells and incubated. The conjugate binds only to human IgG antibodies
that are in turn bound to the antigen coated on the plates. A colorimetric
substrate for the enzyme is added to the wells and incubated for a sufficient

that can be measured using a spectrophotometer set to a wavelength of 405 nm.

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
file for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical
methods are described in the _Analytic Notes_ section below.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. They also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups. The
phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may
be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

If varicella-zoster virus IgG (whole cell) test is positive or if varicella-
zoster virus IgG (gp) test is positive then the confirmed varicella zoster
result is positive. if varicella-zoster virus IgG (gp) test is negative or
equivocal then the confirmed varicella zoster result is negative.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
