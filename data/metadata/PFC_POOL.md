### Polyfluoroalkyl Chemicals - Pooled Samples (Surplus) (PFC_Pool)

####  Data File: PFC_Pool.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2008

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The primary objective of this study was to characterize serum concentrations
of selected polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) in pooled serum samples collected
from children 3-11 years old participants in NHANES 2001-2002.

PFCs have been used extensively since the 1950s in commercial applications,
including surfactants, lubricants, paper and textile coatings, polishes, food
packaging, and fire-retarding foams. Some of these PFCs, including
perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),
persist in humans and the environment and have been detected worldwide in
wildlife. Because of the known animal toxicity of several PFCs; their
ubiquitous presence; and their persistence in humans, wildlife, and the
environment, PFCs research is of interest. Biomonitoring data for these PFCs
in the general population are needed to assess human exposures to these
compounds.

By using a modification of an existing analytical method (Kuklenyik et al.
2005), the following 11 PFCs were measured: perfluorooctane sulfonamide
(PFOSA), 2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Et-PFOSA-AcOH),
2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),
perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBuS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS),
PFOS, perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA), PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA),
perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDeA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA).

## Eligible Sample

Study participants aged 3-11 years from of NHANES 2001 - 2002 with stored
serum available to prepare pooled samples.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum samples from NHANES 2001-2002 were stored frozen before analysis. The
eleven PFCs were measured by using on-line solid-phase extraction (SPE)
coupled to isotope dilution-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The following isotope-labeled internal standards
were used for quantification: 18O2-PFOS (PFOS, PFBuS and PFHxS), 13C2-PFOA
(PFOA, PFHpA), 13C5-PFNA (PFNA), 13C2-PFDeA (PFDeA and PFDoA), 18O2-PFOSA
(PFOSA), D3-Me-PFOSA-AcOH (Me-PFOSA-AcOH), and D5-Et-PFOSA-AcOH (Et-PFOSA-
AcOH). Briefly, 0.25 mL of 0.1 M formic acid and 0.025 mL of internal standard
solution were added to 0.1 mL of serum, and the spiked serum was voltex-mixed
and sonicated. The samples were placed on a commercial Symbiosis on-line SPE
system (Spark Holland, Plainsboro, NJ) for the preconcentration of the
analytes on a Polaris C18 cartridge (7 μm, 10 × 1 mm; Spark Holland). The
analytes were transferred onto a Betasil C8 HPLC column (3 × 50 mm, 5 μm;
ThermoHypersil Keystone, Bellefonte, PA), separated by HPLC (mobile phase A:
20 mM ammonium acetate in water, pH = 4; mobile phase B: methanol), and
detected by negative-ion TurboIonspray-MS/MS on an API 4000 mass spectrometer
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The limits of detection ranged from 0.1
ng/mL to 0.4 ng/mL.

## Data Processing and Editing

Specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to DLS, NCEH, CDC (Atlanta,
Georgia). The analytical approach used, including data processing, was a
modification of a method described in detail in a peer-reviewed publication
(Kuklenyik et al. 2005). Reported results met the Division of Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision (similar to specifications outlined by Westgard
(1981)).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

CDC's laboratory is CLIA '88 certified and practices all quality control (QC)
and assurance procedures dictated by this certification. QC procedures
included the daily analysis of characterized serum pools and the periodic
analysis of proficiency testing materials. Low-concentration (QCL; ~3 ng/mL to
~9 ng/mL, depending upon the analyte) and high-concentration (QCH; ~10 ng/mL
to ~30 ng/mL, depending upon the analyte) QC materials were prepared from a
base calf serum pool, dispensed in 3-mL aliquots and stored at −20 °C. QC
materials were characterized through repeated measurements spanning at least 3
weeks, to define the mean concentrations and the 95% and 99% control limits of
PFCs. Calibration standards, 2 QCH, 2 QCL, reagent and serum blanks were
analyzed with the samples. The concentrations of the two QCH and the two QCL
were averaged to obtain one measurement of QCH and of QCL per batch; these
concentrations were evaluated using standard statistical probability rules.

## Analytic Notes

To prepare the pools, residual serum, collected from the 3-11 year old NHANES
2001-2002 participants and previously analyzed for cotinine, a marker of
environmental tobacco smoke, was used. The 1049 individual samples available
were categorized in 12 demographic groups, each representing a combination of
race/ethnicity, sex, and age (3-5 years and 6-11 years). A total of 937
randomly selected individual samples were used to prepare 24 pools (two per
demographic group). To ensure that no individual sample overly influenced the
pooled results, all samples included in any one pool were of equal volume
(i.e., 0.5 mL). Eleven of the individual serum samples from non-Hispanic black
females 3-5 years of age contributed <0.5 mL. All pools included 21 (3-5 year
old) or 57 (6-11 year old) individual samples randomly selected.

The limits of detection (LODs) were 0.1 ng/mL (PFOSA, PFBuS, PFHxS, PFOA, and
PFNA), 0.2 ng/mL (PFOS, Me-PFOSA-AcOH, Et-PFOSA-AcOH, PFDeA, PFUA, and PFDoA),
and 0.4 ng/mL (PFHpA). The detection limit divided by the square root of 2 is
the value provided for results that are below the limit of detection.
