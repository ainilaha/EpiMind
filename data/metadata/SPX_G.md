## Component Description

Spirometry, which means "the measuring of breath," is a routinely used
clinical pulmonary function test. It measures the amount and speed of air that
a person can exhale after taking in the deepest possible breath. This allows
estimates for lung volume and air flow rates to be made. Results from
Spirometry testing are one key element (among others) needed to diagnose
respiratory disorders, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). These diseases are typically characterized by a reduction in
expiratory air flow rates. This is defined in spirometry as a reduction in the
ratio of the expiratory volume measured in the 1st second of a forceful
exhalation (FEV1) to the total volume of air exhaled in a complete forced
expiration (FVC), the FVC being an estimate of the individual's effective lung
volume. The "Spirometric Measurements Section" of the [NHANES 2011-12
Respiratory Health Spirometry Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/spirometry_procedures_manual.pdf)
contains a basic explanation of interpreting spirometry data.  
  
Spirometry is one of two NHANES 2011-12 components on respiratory health
sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National
Institute of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National
Center for Health Statistics and the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH). Individual Exhaled Nitrous Oxide (ENO), a marker of
airways inflammation, is also measured. The objective of the Spirometry data
collection is to provide health examination data to estimate the current
prevalence of asthma and COPD in the U.S. population. The data is also
intended to help produce updated spirometric reference data for the U.S.
population. National-level Spirometry data was collected in NHANES I
(1971-1975), NHANES II (1976-1980), NHANES III (1988-1994) and most recently
in NHANES 2007-10. Comparisons of the current data with that from previous
studies will help to identify trends in respiratory conditions over time.  
  
Eligible participants performed an initial or "baseline" 1st test spirometry
examination. Then a selected subsample of participants whose Baseline 1st Test
Spirometry results showed a FEV1/FVC ratio below the lower limit of normal
and/or below 70% were asked to repeat spirometry after inhaling a
β2-adrenergic bronchodilator medication to open up their airways. This helps
differentiate asthma from COPD (Pellegrino, Viegi, Brusasco, et al. 2005).
Asthma patients usually show improvements in post-bronchodilator spirometry
testing, while patients with COPD exhibit little, if any, response to the
medication. Spirometric testing using β2-adrenergic bronchodilator is
routinely employed by clinicians to diagnose asthma in both children and
adults, and current clinical practice guidelines (NHLBI Expert Panel Report,
2007) consider post-bronchodilator spirometry testing is essential for the
initial diagnosis of asthma. Second test post bronchodilator spirometry
studies had not been performed in previous NHANES surveys.



## Eligible Sample

Survey participants aged 6 to 79 years were eligible for the Spirometry
Component. Specific exclusion criteria used for Baseline Spirometry included
criteria employed in earlier NHANES. Excluded from testing were examinees that
had current chest pain or a physical problem with forceful expiration, were
taking supplemental oxygen, had recent surgery of the eye, chest or the
abdomen, heart attack, stroke, tuberculosis exposure, or had recently coughed
up blood. Adults with a personal history of detached retina or a collapsed
lung and children with painful ear infections were also excluded. In NHANES
2011-12, Baseline (1st test) Spirometry data was collected for 7,173 sample
persons.  
  
Participants completing Baseline spirometry were only selected for follow-up
Bronchodilator 2nd Test Spirometry if their baseline spirometry values
indicated possible airflow obstruction that might indicate the presence of
asthma or COPD. The participant's baseline spirometry results were evaluated
by a computerized algorithm and examinees with an FEV1/FVC% less than the
Lower Limit of Normal (LLN) determined for his or her age, sex, weight,
height, and race/ethnicity, or those who had a FEV1/FVC% less than 70% were
considered eligible for bronchodilator testing. These two criteria were used
so that NHANES data could be compared with previous epidemiology studies that
used these two different formulas. For the first criterion the LLN for the
FEV1/FVC was calculated based on the sample person's age, gender, height and
race/ethnicity in three major groups (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican-American). For participants aged 8-79 the FEV1/FVC% LLN was as defined
by NHANES III data (Hankinson, Odencrantz, Fedan, 1999) and for children aged
6-7 it was as defined by Wang et al. (1993). The administrative variable
SPDBRONC indicates whether the participant was considered eligible for
Bronchodilator 2nd Test Spirometry. The variable SPXBSTAT provides the
bronchodilator study exam status.  
  
Participants eligible for Bronchodilator 2nd Test Spirometry were referred to
the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) Physician for further evaluation as
documented in the Respiratory Health Bronchodilator Procedures Manual. The
Bronchodilator testing protocol was explained and the participant was further
screened for the presence of any exclusion criteria for bronchodilator
administration. These included certain cardiovascular conditions (uncontrolled
blood pressure, irregular pulse on examination, taking medication for major
arrhythmia, having an implanted defibrillator, or history of congenital heart
disease) or taking certain prescription medications (a monamine oxidase
inhibitor, an anticonvulsant, a tricyclic antidepressant plus current
treatment for cardiac disease, potassium lowering drugs). Examinees were also
excluded from bronchodilator administration if they had already recently taken
a β2-adrenergic bronchodilator, or had a previous adverse reaction to
albuterol. Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were also excluded.  
  
Following eligibility screening, the MEC physician obtained written informed
consent and administered two puffs of the β2-adrenergic bronchodilator
albuterol. The examinee was then required to wait a minimum of ten minutes
before proceeding to the Spirometry exam room to obtain a repeat 2nd Test
Bronchodilator spirometry study. In NHANES 2011-12 a total of 457 participants
performed Bronchodilator (2nd Test) Spirometry.



## Protocol and Procedure

Testing procedures met the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society
(ATS) (Miller, Hankinson, Brusasco el al. 2005). The protocol was similar to
that used in NHANES III (1998-1994); however, there was one change. In NHANES
2011-12 the health Technician's goal was to obtain three acceptable quality
spirometry maneuvers, whereas in NHANES III the Technician's goal was to
obtain five acceptable maneuvers. To ensure data comparability between NHANES
cycles, the same spirometers that were employed for the NHANES III spirometry
examination (1988-1994) were used for NHANES 2011-12 data collection. These
were Ohio 822/827 dry-rolling seal volume spirometers. The devices were
reconditioned for use in the current survey and were maintained by the NIOSH
laboratories. In NHANES 2011-12, unlike NHANES III, a new in-line biological
filter (A-M Systems PFT Filter Kit B) was fitted to each spirometry hose to
minimize infection risks to the participant.  
  
Spirometry was performed in the standing position unless the participant was
physically limited. The participant was asked to elevate the chin and extend
the neck slightly and place a nose clip on his or her nose during testing, the
latter to prevent air leaks. He/she was then instructed to perform a series of
maximal forced expiratory maneuvers. In each maneuver, the participant took
the deepest breath possible to fill the lungs with air, then put the
mouthpiece into his/her mouth making a tight seal and then blew the air out as
hard and fast as possible. Participants, aged 6-10 years were asked to blow
out the air for a minimum of 3 seconds of exhalation, whereas those aged 11-79
years were asked to blow out the air for a minimum of 6 seconds of exhalation.  
  
Spirometry testing for an individual continued until he/she was able to
achieve a reproducible spirogram, or until a maximum of eight spirometry
curves had been obtained, or until the participant could not continue. The
overall goal was for the participant to achieve three acceptable exhalation
maneuvers by ATS criteria in which the two highest values for the FVC and the
FEV1 (each taken from an acceptable forced expiratory maneuver) showed minimal
variability: i.e. the two largest FVC values taken from 2 acceptable curves
should agree within 150 ml, and similarly for the two largest values for the
FEV1. The procedure for the Bronchodilator (2nd Test) Spirometry, performed
after the participant had taken the β2-adrenergic bronchodilator albuterol,
was identical to the procedure for the Baseline 1st test. Please refer to the
NHANES 2011-12 Repiratory Health Spirometry Procedure manual for full details
on the testing protocol, and for detailed criteria for a reproducible
spirogram.



## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The NIOSH Division of Respiratory Disease Studies served as the NHANES
Spirometry training and quality control consultant. Each MEC Health Technician
received formal training and satisfactorily completed the NIOSH-approved
spirometry course. Additionally, all NHANES spirometry data were reviewed by
expert reviewers at the NIOSH quality control center on an ongoing basis. MEC
Technicians received continuous feedback on their performance throughout the
survey.  
  
The Respiratory Health Spirometry Procedures Manual provides detailed
descriptions of the quality assurance and quality control measures that were
used for the NHANES 2011-12 Spirometry examination. The Chief Health
Technician at each MEC monitored ongoing staff performance in the field.
Health technician performance was also monitored using direct observation at
periodic site visits by NIOSH consultants and project officers from Westat
(the data collection contractor) and NHANES. Spirometry equipment was
calibrated through regularly scheduled quality control checks by the Health
Technicians. These were verified by supervisory staff.



## Data Processing and Editing

All spirometry data collected were reviewed by expert consultants at the NIOSH
quality control center where data processing and editing were performed to
ensure internal data consistency.



## Analytic Notes

Summary results datasets are provided for both 1st and 2nd test Spirometry.
These give the single best (highest) overall value for the following
parameters taken from reproducible curves. Note that in this dataset, an
individual best value for a specific variable could be taken from any of the
individual acceptable curves that the participant performed. The summary data
set format is similar to that previously released for the NHANES III data. The
spirometry summary data release variables are:  
  

SPXNFVC | FVC: Forced Vital Capacity, ml (estimated lung volume)  
---|---  
SPXNEV | EV (ml): Extrapolated Volume, ml.  
SPXNFEV5 | FEV0.5: Forced Expiratory Volume 1st 1/2 Second  
SPXNFEV7 | FEV0.75: Forced Expiratory Volume 1st 3/4 Second  
SPXNFEV1 | FEV1: Forced Expiratory Volume 1st Second  
SPXNFEV3 | FEV3: Forced Expiratory Volume 1st 3 Seconds  
SPXNFEV6 | FEV6 (ml): Forced Expiratory Volume 1st 6 Seconds  
SPXNPEF | PEF: Peak Expiratory Flow Rate, ml/sec  
SPXNF257 | FEF25-75%: Forced Expiratory Flow Rate, Mid Exhalation, ml/sec  
SPXNFET | FET: Forced Expiratory Time, sec  
  
In addition, each summary dataset contains the following administrative
variables:  
  
The Number of Acceptable Curves  
FVC Quality Rating  
FEV1 Quality Rating  
Examinee Effort Quality Rating  
  
The following administrative variables are provided to support analysis of the
summary best-test spirometry datasets.  
  
SPDBRONC: This is an administrative variable indicating whether a participant
was considered eligible for bronchodilator and 2nd Test spirometry. The
reference values used in determining SPDBRONC were derived from prediction
equations (described earlier) based on age, race, gender, and height values
available at examination time. As a result of data editing prior to public
release some of these values changed. Additionally, when this protocol was
developed, specific equations were not available for the non-Mexican American
Hispanic population, categorized as "Other Hispanic" in NHANES public release
files, and the non-Hispanic, non-black, non-white population, categorized as
"Other Race" in NHANES public release files. Using public release values,
other prediction equations, and /or alternate race classifications for the
prediction equations may result in differences in bronchodilator eligibility.  
  
When using 2nd test spirometry data, analysts may choose to use SPDBRONC, or
they may use the publicly-released values for age, race, gender and height.
Additionally, analysts can use equations now available and/or other criteria
for determining bronchodilator eligibility.  
  
FEV1 and FVC Quality Codes: These variables rate the quality of the summary
best-test FEV1 and FVC values. The variables are SPXNQFVC and SPXNQFV1 for 1st
Test Spirometry and SPXBQFVC and SPXBQFV1 for 2nd Test Spirometry. Quality of
the FEV1 and FVC estimates was rated on a scale from A-F defined as follows:  
  
A= Exceeds ATS data collection standards: 3 acceptable curves present and 2
reproducible curves; 2 observed values within 100 ml.  
B= Meets ATS data collection standards: 3 acceptable curves present and 2
reproducible curves; 2 observed values within 150 ml.  
C= Potentially usable value, but does not meet all ATS standards. Estimates
usually based on 2 curve results with values within 200 ml. of each other.  
D= Questionable result, use with caution  
F= Results not valid  
  
For those who want to perform analytic studies using data that excludes
subjects that may not have perfect data, they should simply use data only with
FEV1 and FVC quality grades A and B. Grade C indicates less than a perfect
test, for example instances where there are only 2 acceptable curves achieved
but where the data most likely represents a value where the subject made a
maximal effort. Generally data with quality grades D and F are not used for
data analysis. In the NHANES 2011-12 data collection 85% of baseline
spirometry summary best-test FVC estimates were of quality A or B, and 95%
were of quality A, B, or C. For FEV1, 88% of summary best-test FVC estimates
were of quality A or B, and 96% were of quality A, B, or C.  
  
Additional Variables Relating to Data Quality: The summary spirometry datasets
also provide a variable for the number of acceptable spirometry curves
achieved by the participant judged by ATS criteria. These are the variables
SPDNACC for Baseline 1st Test Spirometry and SPDBACC for Bronchodilator 2nd
Test Spirometry. Also, data providing a summary rating of the overall
spirometry curve quality for the participant are provided by the variables
SPXNQEFF and SPXBQEFF.  
  
Spirometry Exam Status Codes:Baseline 1st Test Spirometry has an overall exam
status code (SPXNSTAT) which provides analysts with a single variable to
identify those survey participants with complete or partial spirometry exams,
those who were excluded from spirometry, or those who were eligible for
spirometry but for whom the exam was not done. A similar variable (SPXBSTAT)
is provided for the subset of participants who were selected for
Bronchodilator 2nd Test Spirometry. For these variables a complete exam is
defined as one in which both the best-test FEV1 and FVC estimates had quality
ratings of A, B, or C. Partial exams are exams with any other spirometry data
collected that was of lesser quality.  
  
Spirometry Exam Comment Codes:Comment codes were added by the MEC Health
Technicians, during data collection, to document the reasons why it was only
possible to collect partial exam data for participants, and to document the
reasons why Spirometry exams were not done if a participant was otherwise
eligible. The comment code variable for Baseline 1st Test Spirometry is
SPXNCMT, and for Bronchodilator 2nd test Spirometry it is SPXBCMT. Analysts
may wish to review the comment code information for the Spirometry data prior
to specific types of data analysis.  
  
Sample Weights: The NHANES MEC examination sample weights, i.e., the full
sample 2-Year MEC Exam Weight (WTMEC2YR), should be used to analyze the
2011-12 spirometry data. Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.  
  
Additional 2011-12 NHANES Data on Respiratory Health: The raw data for the
spirometry curves attempted by each participant in the NHANES 2011-12
Spirometry Component is released in a separate dataset (SPXRAW_G). The raw
data permits users to graph a participant's spirometry test curves. It is also
intended for the use of data analysts who may want to perform more advanced
modeling studies using the raw data. Data files can be combined with the
2007-12 datasets to provide a larger dataset for analysis.  
  
The NHANES 2011-12 Respiratory Health Component also included testing for
Exhaled Nitric Oxide (ENX_G), and Household Interview Questionnaire data on a
prior diagnosis of asthma and COPD (MCQ_G), recent respiratory symptoms such
as cough and wheezing (RDQ_G), data for the participant's current prescription
medications (RXQ_RX_G; RXQ_DRUG_G), and data for occupational risk factors for
COPD (OCQ_G).
