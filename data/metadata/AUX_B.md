### Audiometry (AUX_B)

####  Data File: AUX_B.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2005

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES 2001-2002 Audiometry Examination Component consists of four parts:

1) A pre-exam audiometric questionnaire: This is a series of questions to
identify conditions that would affect how audiometric testing is conducted, or
how results are interpreted. Questions include whether the subject has ear
tubes, a current cold or ear problem, or recent loud noise exposure. Note that
more extensive data relating to study subject's hearing status are contained
in the audiometry questionnaire (AUQ) section of the NHANES Sample Person
Interview Questionnaire. Questionnaire information regarding occupational
noise exposure can be found in the Occupational (OCQ) section of the NHANES
Sample Person Interview Questionnaire.

2) A brief otoscopic screening (physical) exam of the ear canals and eardrums:
This was performed to identify abnormalities which would require alternate
audiometric procedures or influence interpretation of test results, and to
identify conditions which might require medical referral. The exam screened
for excessive or impacted ear cerumen (wax), physical abnormalities, or
collapsing external ear canals.

3) Tympanometry: This is an objective assessment of middle ear function by
testing the mobility of the eardrum in response to changes in air pressure
within the ear canal. It was used to identify middle ear pathologies that
might contribute to hearing loss. Tympanometric data, included in this primary
Audiometry data file consists of quantitative measurement data for middle ear
volume, pressure, compliance, and gradient.

4) Pure tone air conduction audiometry: This measures hearing sensitivity by
presenting pure tone signals to the ear through earphones and by varying the
intensity of the signals until a subject's hearing threshold at that frequency
is determined. Testing was performed at frequencies across the range of human
hearing.

## Eligible Sample

The Audiometry Component tested a ½ sample of U.S. adults ages 20-69 years.
Subjects using hearing aids who were not able to remove them for testing and
subjects who had sufficient ear pain at the time of the exam that they could
not tolerate headphones were excluded from the Audiometry Component. There
were no other precluding conditions for any part of the audiologic exam.

## Protocol and Procedure

All Audiometry Component sections were performed by a trained examiner on
examinees aged 20-69 in a dedicated, sound-isolating room in the mobile
examination center (MEC). Hearing threshold testing was conducted on both ears
of examinees at seven frequencies (500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 6000, and 8000
Hz). Testing was conducted according to a modified Hughson Westlake procedure
using the automated testing mode of the audiometer, except as indicated below.
The effective range for automated audiometric testing was from -10 to 100
decibels (dB) at 500 to 6000 Hz and -10 to 90 dB at 8000 Hz. Thresholds could
be tested through 120 dB (110 dB at 8000 Hz) using manual audiometric mode.
Observed values, therefore, varied between -10 and 120 dB. If an examinee did
not respond to the signal tone at any level for one or more frequencies
because of deafness or severe hearing loss, a threshold level of 666 was
entered. Manual testing was also conducted when the examinee could not operate
the response switch or responded too slowly for the audiometer to accurately
record the response.

In some instances, if a pure tone audiometric signal is sufficiently loud, it
can "cross over" and be heard by the opposite ear via bone conduction. When
this occurs, it is difficult to determine if the threshold obtained is truly
the threshold of the test ear, or an artifact of the non-test ear (which may
have better hearing). For the current study, a crossover retesting protocol
was performed whenever the observed threshold at any given frequency was
poorer in one ear than the other by 25 dB at 500 and 1000 Hz; or 40 dB at any
higher frequency. Retesting was accomplished using insert earphones, which are
smaller and have less direct contact with the head. Thus, a much louder
stimulus is required before crossover occurs. Due to the complexity of the
procedure, masking was not employed in this survey.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Instrumentation for the Audiometry Component included an Interacoustics Model
AD226 audiometer with standard TDH-39 headphones and Etymotic EarTone 3A
insert earphones. Tympanometry was performed using a Micro Audiometrics
Earscan Acoustic Impedance Tympanometer. All testing was performed within a
sound-isolating booth, located in a dedicated room in the MEC. Audiometric
calibration and background noise levels were checked using a Quest Model 1800
Precision Integrating Sound Level Meter and Model OB-300 1/3-1/1 octave filter
set. Daily monitoring of calibration and ambient noise levels was accomplished
with a Quest Model BA-201-25 Bioacoustic Simulator and Octave Band Monitor.
All data from each of the four sections of the Audiometry Component were
entered directly into the computerized NHANES survey database system. Data
from the Interacoustics Model AD226 audiometer and Micro Audiometrics Earscan
Acoustic Impedance tympanometer were captured electronically and uploaded into
the survey information system automatically.

The audiometers used in this survey met the specifications of ANSI S3.6-1996
for Type 3 audiometers. An acoustic calibration check to measure the output
and linearity of the audiometer (through both standard and insert earphones)
was conducted before the examinations began at each MEC site using a Quest
Model 1800 sound level meter kit; a complete acoustic calibration check was
also conducted at the end of each stand. Throughout the stand, output of the
audiometer was monitored daily using a Quest Model BA-201-25 bioacoustic
simulator, and a daily listening check (tone quality, attenuator accuracy,
headphone cords, crossover, etc.) was also performed. Standard and insert
earphones were checked on an alternating basis. If a unit did not meet
specifications, it was sent for servicing, and a fully calibrated backup unit
was used for examinations. Manufacturer's calibration (traceable to the
National Institute of Standards and Technology [NIST]) was performed annually
on each audiometer.

An environmental noise survey was also conducted at the beginning of each
stand using the Quest 1800 sound level meter. The survey was repeated weekly
throughout the stand. The audiometric test room was required to meet or exceed
the specifications of ANSI S3.1-1991 for ears covered testing. A Quest Model
BA-201-25 Bioacoustic Simulator and Octave Band Monitor was used to
continuously measure the background noise levels in the audiometric test room
during audiometric examinations. Pure tone audiometric testing was not
performed if ambient noise levels in the test booth exceeded maximum
permissible levels. A comprehensive calibration (traceable to NIST) of the
sound level meter and bioacoustic simulator were performed annually by the
manufacturer. The physical volume calibration of the Micro Audiometric Earscan
tympanometer was checked at the start and end of each stand and daily
throughout the stand. Air pressure was calibrated automatically by the unit
each time it was turned on. The tympanometer also received an exhaustive NIST-
traceable calibration check annually.

As an additional quality measure, all audiograms, whether conducted in
automated or manual mode, tested the 1000 Hz frequency twice in each ear as a
measure of the reliability of the subject's responses. Pure tone audiograms
were not accepted if there was more than a 10 dB difference between them. For
further details regarding any of these procedures, analysts should consult the
NHANES Audiometry/Tympanometry Procedures Manual. (National Center for Health
Statistics, 2001)

The MEC Health Technicians who performed the Audiometry Examination Component
of NHANES were professionally trained by a certified audiologist from the
National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH). NIOSH also
conducted health technician performance monitoring of each technician on a
regular basis. Field visits to each MEC were conducted by the NIOSH
Audiologist at least three times per year. Additionally, NCHS Project Officers
visited the MECs approximately twice per year to observe the audiometry
examinations and verify that standard testing procedures were being followed.
NIOSH consultants provided the MEC health technicians with annual retraining
and protocol updates.

The quantitative tympanometric measurements reported in this data file
represent the single best of two curves obtained during testing. Subjective
quality ratings for these tympanograms are the variables AUAREQC and AUALEQC.
These represent a qualitative assessment of tympanogram quality by the
consulting Audiologist. Please note, however, that this rating process scored
tympanograms on the basis of quality, not normality. Abnormal tympanograms
were classified as "good" if they were consistent with a subject's audiometric
data, including otoscopy, numeric tympanometry readings, and audiogram.

## Data Processing and Editing

All data were captured into the NHANES computerized database system, with
audiometric and tympanometric data automatically uploaded. On a continuous
basis, a consulting Audiologist performed a clinical review of all data for
each subject as it was received, checking for quality and consistency. In
addition, a computerized data editing program was developed to check for
logical inconsistencies in the data and technician errors, and to cross-check
other issues affecting data quality (consistency in identifying potential
instances where crossover effects might have occurred, assurance of
randomization of the initial test ear, etc.). Back-end edits of the data were
performed as needed when errors were detected.

## Analytic Notes

This examination was administered to a ½ sample of participants in the MEC.
Therefore, the Audiometry sub-sample weights provided with the Audiometry data
file should be used for data analysis. For more information on the use of
sample weights in current NHANES data analysis, refer to the current NHANES
Analytic and Reporting Guidelines. Please note that for Audiometric data
analysis combining NHANES 1999-2000 and NHANES 2001-2002 data, the special
4-year examination weights should be employed (WTSAU4YR).

Audiologic data analysis is a complex procedure and requires a thorough
knowledge of the specialty content area for valid results to be obtained. If
an analyst does not have professional experience in this area, it is
recommended that audiologic consultation be obtained to help formulate and
review the results of the analysis. Data analysts should be especially aware
of the fact that the number "666" in all primary audiometric frequency data
fields (AUXU1K1R through AUXU8KL) as well as in all repeat test frequencies
(AUXR1K1R through AUXR8KL) is a qualitative code for non-response at a
particular frequency, and does not represent actual measured decibel hearing
threshold values. They should be appropriately edited prior to any numerical
data analysis.
