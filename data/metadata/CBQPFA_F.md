### Consumer Behavior Phone Follow-up Module - Adult (CBQPFA_F)

####  Data File: CBQPFA_F.xpt

#####  First Published: April 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Consumer Behavior Phone Follow-up Module - Adult (CBQPFA) section provides
personal interview data for participants 16 years and older on various dietary
related consumer behavior topics. Topics included in the section are:

  * Factors that influence decisions to eat out 
  * Use of nutrition information labeled for restaurant foods 
  * Awareness of MyPyramid program and knowledge of its recommendations 
  * Fatalistic attitudes about body weight 
  * Attitudes about changing current diet 
  * Factors that influence food choices at a grocery store or supermarket 
  * Use of food labels 
  * Use of organic foods 

In 2007, a Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module was added to the
NHANES. This module was developed in collaboration with the Economic Research
Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). It was designed to
collect information on people's knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward
nutrition and food choices.

The FCBS module has two elements: a core set of questions asked in the
household interview, and a supplementary module asked in a 15-minute telephone
follow-up interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data
collection cycle.

Data from the core set of questions in the 2009-2010 FCBS module have been
included in the [Diet Behavior
(DBQ)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/dbq_f.htm) and [Consumer
Behavior (CBQ)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/cbq_f.htm) sections
and released in separate files available on the [NHANES
website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=2009).

The FCBS supplementary phone follow-up module was designed to be administered
differently depending upon the survey participant's age. For participants aged
16 years and older, we were interested in how their behavior related to their
own diet and health. Therefore, the data were collected at person-level,
meaning each participant answered the questions for himself/herself.. For
children aged 1-15 years old, the research interest was to see how the adults'
beliefs and behaviors can be related to the intake of children in the family.
For example, the fast food buying habits of an adult may relate to the dietary
intake of the children in the same family. Therefore, the FCBS phone follow up
data were collected at the family level for children 1-15 years old. The
questions were asked to one adult respondent in the family, the data were then
linked to all eligible children in the home. The adult was not providing a
proxy response for the child but giving his/her own information in this
interview.

In 2009-2010, the following changes were made to the FCBS supplementary phone
follow up module:

  1. Two questions were added to ask respondents the reason(s) they use or do not use food labels. The responses were coded into 22 data items: 12 reasons for using (CBQ738a-CBQ738cd) and 10 reasons for not using (CBQ698a-CBQ698cd) food labels. 
  2. Seven questions (CBQ790-CBQ820) were added to ask about the use of organic foods by food categories. 
  3. One question (CBQ825) was added to ascertain the awareness of the USDA organic seal. 

Similar to other datasets in the NHANES 2009-2010 release cycle, all FCBS
related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number (SEQN). For
more information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the documentations
accompanying the datasets.

## Eligible Sample

All NHANES participants aged 1 year and older who complete a dietary interview
in the mobile examination center (MEC) are eligible to participate in the FCBS
follow-up interview. However, only data from survey participants aged 16 years
and older are included in this dataset. Data collected for participants aged
1-15 years are released in a separate dataset
([CBQPFC_F](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/cbqpfc_f.htm) ).

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The FCBS follow-up interview was administered to participants aged 16 years
and older, over the telephone, after the day 2 dietary interview (Note: The
day 2 dietary interviews are conducted by telephone 3-10 days after the health
examination in the MEC). After the day 2 dietary interview was completed,
participants were given the option to continue with the FCBS interview or have
it scheduled for another day or time.

All the questions were asked by trained interviewers using the Computer-
Assisted Telephone Interviewing - CATI system. A hand card booklet was given
to the participants before they left the MEC for them to use later during the
follow-up interview. When necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to
respondents.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CATI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CATI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All of the data were reviewed by
the NHANES field office staff for accuracy and completeness.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some
variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of
the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure
concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing
process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e.,
CBQ) to a D (i.e., CBD). For example, some data were collected using two
variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable), but combined
into a single variable for data release purposes.

## Analytic Notes

Only participants who complete a dietary interview in the MEC are eligible to
participate in the FCBS follow-up interview. For the 2009-2010 NHANES, there
were 6,399 individuals aged 16 years and older eligible for the FCBS follow-up
interview; of these 5,206 were considered respondents for the FCBS.

Most analyses of NHANES data use data collected in the MEC and the variable
WTMEC2YR should be used for the sample weights. However, for the FCBS follow-
up data, different sample weights are recommended for analysis. The dietary
day one sample weight (WTDRD1) is recommended for use in analysis with data
from FCBS follow-up module (either alone or when FCBS follow-up data are used
in conjunction with MEC data). The set of weights WTDRD1 is applicable to the
5,206 respondents with FCBS follow-up data. Day 1 weights were constructed by
taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting for (a) the
additional non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day of the week
for the dietary intake data collection. These Day 1 weights are more variable
than the MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated standard
errors using Day 1 data and Day 1 weights are larger than standard errors for
similar estimates based on MEC weights. For more detailed information on the
dietary Day 1 weights, refer to the [documentations accompanying the dietary
datasets](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2009-2010/drxdoc_f.htm).

Additional explanation of sample weights and appropriate uses are included in
the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx). Please
also refer to the on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on other
analytic issues.
