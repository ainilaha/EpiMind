## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The NHANES Audio Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI) was conducted in a
private room in the MEC in either English or Spanish. The ACASI enables the
respondents both to hear questions through earphones and read questions on the
computer and to move at their own speed as they touch the screen to indicate
their response. No proxy respondents or translators were used in situations
when the respondents could not self-report.



## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The NHANES ACASI system had built-in consistency checks, including range
checks, valid response checks, and checks for logical relationships. Soft
edits alerted the respondents to a potential error or problem, but allowed the
respondents to proceed after confirming that the entered value was correct.
Hard edits prohibited the respondents from continuing with the ACASI until the
error is corrected. Respondents also had the right to refuse to answer any
question.
