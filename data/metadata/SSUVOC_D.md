##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous

## Component Description

The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 gave the Food
and Drug Administration regulatory authority over tobacco products. In Section
907(a), the Act states that the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
establish tobacco product standards. These product standards shall also
include provisions for the testing of the tobacco products. In order to
determine the effectiveness of these product standards, it is critical that
surveillance systems be in place before the standards are enacted to determine
whether they impact exposure of people who continue to use tobacco product.
NHANES is an ideal source of human samples for assessing smokers in multiple
locations around the country. NHANES will provide the most robust dataset
possible for identifying changes in exposure of smokers that should result
from enactment of tobacco product standards.

We anticipate that the results of this survey of tobacco exposure biomarkers
will be used by FDA, other government agencies, and research institutions. The
NHANES data will be used to determine the effectiveness of initial product
standards and direct whether further changes to product standards need to be
made.

Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is ubiquitous. Chronic exposure
to high levels of some VOCs can lead to cancer and neurocognitive dysfunction.
Nearly 200 VOCs have been associated with adverse health effects in
occupational studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in
general population groups. Metabolites of some VOCs can be detected in urine
following exposure events. Therefore, information on exposure to these
compounds, as measured by their metabolite concentrations in urine, is
essential to understand the levels of hazardous VOCs to which the general
population is exposed.

## Eligible Sample

Urine collected from participants in NHANES 2005-2006 aged 12 years and older
from a one-half subsample were eligible. Tests were conducted on residual
urine samples.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure for the measurement of VOC metabolites
in human urine using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with
electro spray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) (Alwis et al., 2012).
Chromatographic separation is achieved using an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 (Part no.
186003540, 1.8 mm x 2.1 mm x 150 mm, Waters, Inc.) column with 15 mM ammonium
acetate and acetonitrile as the mobile phases. The eluent from the column is
ionized using an electrospray interface to generate and transmit negative ions
into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative response factors (ratio of
native analyte to stable isotope labeled internal standard) with known
standard concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The analytical measurements were conducted following strict quality
control/quality assurance CLIA guidelines. Along with the study samples, each
analytical run included high- and low-concentration quality control materials
(QCs) and reagent blanks to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
The concentrations of the high-concentration QCs and the low-concentration
QCs, averaged to obtain one measurement of high-concentration QC and low-
concentration QC for each run, were evaluated using standard statistical
probability rules (Caudill et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

**Bias Adjustments Applied to VOC Metabolites in Urine Assay in NHANES 2005
-2006 cycle (Surplus)**

Several systematic biases were discovered in measurements of certain urinary
VOC metabolites in the 2005 - 2006 and 2011 - 2012 NHANES cycles. Upon further
investigation, in April 2022, the following adjustments have been applied to
the previously published data and included in the present dataset.

**A.** **Adjustment to correct calibrator errors of the CDC lab prepared
calibration materials**

During the 2005-2006 and 2011-2012 NHANES cycles, calibrators used for tests
on several VOC metabolites were prepared from a multi-analyte stock solution
formulated from neat materials prepared by the testing lab at CDC. Beginning
with the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle, calibrators and the multi-analyte stock
solution were prepared externally. A systematic bias was observed between the
cycles that used in-house calibration materials and the cycle using externally
prepared calibration materials. The systematic nature of these biases
permitted retrospective adjustment through a statistical approach based on
linear regression modeling where adjusted measurements are predicted from
unadjusted measurements using suitable data. The "statistical recalibrations"
implemented here have the general form of a univariate linear regression
equation (accounting for dilution factors routinely used during measurement):

where exp[*] and ln(*) are the natural exponential and natural logarithm
functions, respectively. Natural log-transformation of both the un-adjusted
and adjusted measurements moderated adverse influence on model fit from
extreme measurements. The estimated regression slope and intercept are _m_ and
_b_ , respectively, which are tabulated below for each analyte. The dilution
factor was accounted for only once for each analyte that underwent more than
one statistical recalibration (e.g., URXMB3). Statistical recalibration for
the mass fraction of salt (URXHP2, URXGAM) only required a regression slope
(i.e.,

and residuals exhibited distributions with good approximation to normality, as
well as stable variance over the observed range of measurements. These
favorable diagnostics demonstrate the efficacy of statistical recalibration
for the retrospective amelioration of systematic bias.

_Correction for Change in Internal Standard_

Isotopically labeled internal standards were not commercially available for
URXMB3 and URXHP2 during analysis of NHANES 2005-2006\. Instead, the lab used
surrogate internal standards.  Isotopically labeled internal standards later
became available for purchase and were used in the NHANES 2011-2012 cycle. A
systematic bias between these two cycles was noted and confirmed to be due to
the internal standard change.

Analyte | m used in correction | b used in correction  
---|---|---  
URXMB3 | 1.08034 | 0.73526  
URXHP2 | 0.99437 | 0.21216  
  


_Correction for Variation in Preparation of Neat Native Metabolites Standards_

Validations of the externally prepared calibrators suggested that the
calibrators previously prepared by the CDC testing lab were inaccurate due to
special requirements for handling and preparing accurate solutions from neat
materials, some of which are highly hygroscopic. Below is the list of analytes
affected and the corresponding adjustment factors used in correction equation.

Analyte | m used in correction | b used in correction  
---|---|---  
URXAMC | 0.99687 | 0.12843  
URXCEM | 1.01462 | -0.13642  
URXDHB | 0.99654 | 0.04687  
URXHEM | 1.00947 | 0.30195  
URXHPM | 0.98949 | -0.23802  
URXMAD | 1.00736 | -0.18993  
URXTTC | 1.03057 | -0.0746  
URXMB3 | 0.97491 | -0.43202  
URX2DC | 1.00155 | -0.32374  
  


_Correction for Mass Fraction of Salt in Neat Compound Standard_

During the 2005-2006 and 2011-2012 NHANES cycles, calibrators were prepared
from a multi-analyte stock solutions formulated from neat materials in-house.
Beginning with the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle, calibrators and the multi-analyte
stock solutions were prepared externally. A systematic bias between the cycles
that used in-house calibration materials and the cycle using externally
prepared calibration materials was observed for analytes listed in the table
below. Further validation confirmed that the large mass fraction of salt in
the neat materials was not accounted for during formulation of in-house
calibration materials. This discrepancy between the calculated concentration
of the calibrators and the actual concentration led to a systematic bias in
results for URXHP2 and URXGAM.

Analyte | m used in correction  
---|---  
URXHP2 | 0.5471199  
URXGAM | 0.57755045  
  


**Correction for Stereoisomerism in Urine Samples**

URXMB3 occurs in human urine predominantly in the _cis_ isomer, but
quantitation in the NHANES 2005-2006 and NHANES 2011-2012 cycles used
standards containing the _trans_ isomer. This discrepancy led to a systematic
bias in the URXMB3 results. Neat material that is purely _cis_ isomer cannot
be readily obtained, but a predictive regression equation can account for
these quantitative differences.

Analyte | m used in correction | b used in correction  
---|---|---  
URXMB3 | 0.97741 | -0.18775  
  


**B.** **Adjustment to correct calibrator errors of calibration materials
prepared by an external vendor**

_Correction of N-Acetyl-S-(3-Hydroxypropyl-1-Methyl)-L-Cysteine (URXPMM)_

In the 2005-2006 and 2011-2016 NHANES cycles, calibrators used to test
N-Acetyl-S-(3-hydroxypropyl-1-methyl)-L-cysteine (URXPMM) were externally
prepared, by a vendor, from a multi-analyte stock solution formulated from
neat materials. In 2021, accuracy solutions from a new vendor indicated a
systematic bias. Validations conducted by the CDC testing lab confirmed that
the large mass fraction of salt in the neat materials was not accounted for
during formulation of the externally prepared calibration materials from the
previous vendor. This discrepancy between the calculated concentration of the
calibrators and the actual concentration led to a systematic bias in results
for URXPMM. An algebraic correction factor of 0.565 were applied to the
original URXPMM values and released in the present file as below:

URXPMM = URXPMMOriginal × 0.565

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDAAMLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDAAMLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXAAM) provides the
analytic result for the analyte.
