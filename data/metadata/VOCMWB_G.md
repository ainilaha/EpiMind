### Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) - Trihalomethanes/MTBE/Nitromethane -
Blood (VOCMWB_G)

####  Data File: VOCMWB_G.xpt

#####  First Published: February 2018

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Volatile Organic Compounds (Whole Blood) -
Trihalomethanes/MTBE/Nitromethane**  
  
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large group of chemicals that have
been used as solvents, degreasers, and cleaning agents in industry and
consumer products. Many of the VOCs were found to contaminate ground water and
drinking water sources. Because of human health concerns, these VOCs have been
banned or restricted from most uses.

The prevalence of disinfection by-products in drinking water supplies has
raised concerns about possible adverse health effects from chronic exposure to
these potentially carcinogenic compounds. Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was
used as an additive to replace lead in gasoline, but its use was banned after
widespread ground water contamination was discovered.

Inhalation is the most common VOC route of exposure in the general population,
including indoor sources such as paints, adhesives, cleaning solutions, and
aerosolized insecticide sprays; industries producing these solvents; and
contaminated waste disposal sites. Drinking water may contribute to exposure
when underground drinking water supplies are contaminated. After they are
absorbed in the body, VOCs are rapidly eliminated in exhaled breath, or may be
rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine.  

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-half sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Trihalomethanes (THMs), nitromethane (NM: biomarker for halonitromethanes),
and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) are measured in whole blood by solid phase
microextraction/gas chromatography/isotope dilution mass spectrometry
(SPME/GC/isotope dilution MS) based on the method described by Bonin, et al.
The method is applicable to the determination of five VOCs in 3-mL samples of
whole blood with detection limits in the low parts per trillion (pptr) range.
Since non-occupationally exposed individuals have blood VOC concentrations in
this range, the method is applicable for determining these quantities and
investigating cases of low-level exposure to VOCs.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2011-2012 cycle.  

## Laboratory Method Files

[Trihalomethanes/MTBE/Nitromethane Lab Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/labmethods/VOCMWB_G_MET.pdf)
(February 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions until they
are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health, for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the CDC/NCEH Tobacco and Volatile Branch quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2011-2012 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Volatile Toxicant Questionnaire**  

A volatile toxicant questionnaire (VTQ) was administered on the mobile
examination center (MEC), by trained interviewers, using the Computer-Assisted
Personal Interview (CAPI) system. The VTQ section includes data about the SP's
home, activities, amount of time spent in various locations, and exposure to
different chemicals over the past 48 hours. This questionnaire data can be
used in conjunction with the VOC laboratory dataset and found in the Volatile
Toxicant Data File in the NHANES 2011-2012 Questionnaire Data section.  

**Subsample Weights**

Whole blood VOCs were measured in a one-half subsample of persons 12 years and
older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/DEMO_G.htm) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/FASTQX_G.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDVBFLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDVBFLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXVBF)
provides the analytic result for that analyte.
