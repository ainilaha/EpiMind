### Pregnancy Test - Urine (UC_B)

####  Data File: UC_B.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2003

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan was performed on survey
participants 8 years and older. The scan involves radiation exposure to the
whole body. Pregnant women are excluded from the DXA , bioelectrical impedance
and cardiovascular fitness components of the mobile examination center.
Initially, a urine pregnancy test was performed. If the urine test results
were positive, for pregnancy, a serum pregnancy test was also performed.

## Eligible Sample

A pregnancy test was completed on female participants aged 12 to 59 years and
menstruating females aged 8 to 11 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The Iconr 25 hCG (Urine/Serum) test kit is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay
for the qualitative detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine
or serum to aid in the early detection of pregnancy. The test utilizes a
combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to selectively detect
elevated levels of hCG in urine or serum.

## Data Processing and Editing

Urine and serum specimens were tested in the NHANES mobile examination
centers. Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are
discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.
