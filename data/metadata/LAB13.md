## Component Description

**Total Cholesterol and HDL-Cholesterol**

The goals of this component are:

  1. to monitor the prevalence and trends in major cardiovascular conditions and risk factors in the U.S.; and 
  2. to evaluate prevention and treatment programs targeting cardiovascular disease in the U.S. 

The main element of the cardiovascular disease laboratory component in NHANES
is blood lipid levels. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in
the United States. The data will be used to monitor the status of
hyperlipidemia and the success of the National Cholesterol Education Program.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 3 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria were sampled.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Â Data Collection Methods**

In the mobile examination center (MEC) laboratory, blood specimens are
processed, stored, and shipped to the Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein
Analytical Laboratory for analysis.

**Examination Protocol**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are described in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials were
stored under appropriate temperature conditions (stored at -20 degrees
Centigrade) until they were shipped to Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein
Analytical Laboratory for testing. The analytical methods are described in the
Analytic Methodology section of this document.

**Data Collection**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
LPM. Each chapter in the LPM specifies the procedure to be used for
preparation, labeling, processing, preservation, and transport of the
specimens.

**Analytic Methodology**

**Total Cholesterol**

Cholesterol is measured enzymatically in serum or plasma in a series of
coupled reactions that hydrolyze cholesteryl esters and oxidize the 3-OH group
of cholesterol. One of the reaction byproducts, H2O2 is measured
quantitatively in a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction that produces a color.
Absorbance is measured at 500 nm. The color intensity is proportional to
cholesterol concentration. The reaction sequence is as follows:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
cholesteryl ester hydrolase  
Cholesteryl ester + H2O ------------------------------------->cholesterol +
fatty acid

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â cholesterol oxidase  
Cholesterol + O2 \----------------------------> cholest-4-en-3-one + H2O2

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â peroxidase  
2H2O2 \+ 4-aminophenazone + phenol ---------------------> 4-(p-benzoquinone  
monoimino)-phenazone + 4 H2O

**HDL-Cholesterol**

In NHANES 1999-2000, HDL-cholesterol was measured using two methods. A
heparin-manganese (Mn) precipitation method and a direct immunoassay technique
were used. The heparin-Mn method was used for participants ages 6 years and
above. The direct method is used for participants ages 3-5 and for
participants with no heparin-manganese HDL-cholesterol values, usually as a
result of limited sample volume. HDL-cholesterol values less than 40 mg/dL are
associated with increased coronary heart disease risk in adults.

**Heparin-Mn Precipitation Method**

Apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins are removed by precipitation with
heparin sulfate and MnCl2 and cholesterol is measured in the HDL-containing
supernatant. Cholesterol in the HDL-containing supernatant is measured as
described above for total cholesterol.

**HDL-Cholesterol Direct Immunoassay Method**

HDL is measured directly in serum. The apolipoprotein B containing
lipoproteins in the specimen are reacted with a blocking reagent that renders
them non-reactive with the enzymatic cholesterol reagent under conditions of
the assay. The reagents are purchased from Roche/Boehringer-Mannheim
Diagnostics. The method uses sulfated alpha-cyclodextrin in the presence of
Mg+2 , which forms complexes with apoB containing lipoproteins, and
polyethylene glycol-coupled cholesteryl esterase and cholesterol oxidase for
the HDL-cholesterol measurement. The reactions are as follows:

ApoB containing lipoproteins + a-cyclodextrin + Mg+2 \+ dextran SO4 \--->
soluble non-reactive complexes with apoB-containing lipoproteinsÂ

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â PEG-
cholesteryl esterase  
HDL-cholesteryl esters ------------------------------------> HDL-unesterified
cholesterol + fatty acid

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â PEG-cholesterol oxidase  
Unesterified cholesterol + O2 \------------------------------------->
cholestenone + H2O2 Â

H2O2Â + 5-aminophenazone + N-ethyl-N-(3-methylphenyl)-Nâ_succinyl ethylene
diamine + H2O + H+ peroxidase ---> qunoneimine dye + H2O

Absorbance is measured at 600 nm.Â

**Analytical Note**

**Change in Assay Methods Most Likely Responsible for Changes in HDL
Cholesterol values in NHANES 1999-2008**  
  
Researchers are cautioned to interpret trends in HDL cholesterol for NHANES
1999-2008 in view of probable HDL cholesterol method effects. The mean HDL
cholesterol values from 1999-2008 showed changes for sample participants 20
years or older:

Mean HDL Cholesterol Values from 1999-2008 Years | n | Mean HDL(mg/dL)* | SEM**  
---|---|---|---  
1999-2000 | 4117 | 50.6 | 0.7  
2001-2002 | 4691 | 51.9 | 0.28  
2003-2004 | 4475 | 54.1 | 0.38  
2005-2006 | 4481 | 54.6 | 0.36  
2007-2008 | 5332 | 51.9 | 0.53  
  
  

* Weighted mean to account for complex sample design of NHANES   
**SEM is the standard error the mean

  

The changes in average HDL Cholesterol levels from 1999-2008 were seen across
various age, gender and race-ethnicity groups indicating a method effect. The
HDL cholesterol was analyzed in 1999-2002 using two methods - heparin
manganese precipitation and a direct HDL immunoassay depending on the
participant age and amount of specimen. Most participants in 1999-2002 were
measured by the precipitation method. Starting in 2003, all HDL cholesterol
samples were analyzed using the direct HDL cholesterol immunoassay method. The
heparin-manganese precipitation method and direct immunoassay method for
1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2005-2006 showed an undesirable bias (>4%) when
compared to the laboratory's HDL-cholesterol quality controls (Solomon Park
Research Laboratories, Kirkland, WA) that were assigned values established by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC HDL cholesterol
reference method uses heparin-manganese to precipitate HDL-cholesterol and the
Abell-Kendall method to measure cholesterol. The HDL cholesterol for
1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2005-2006 were adjusted using:

Corrected HDL =Â Â Â Â Â Â (Solomon Park assigned HDL value) x (Participant
HDL)Â Â Â Â Â Â  
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (Quality Control HDL
value associated with Participant sample)

The bias for the HDL cholesterol method for 2003-2004 was acceptable (<4%) and
the participant results were not corrected. In addition, there was a change in
instrumentation in 2005-2006 and there were several modifications of the
direct HDL cholesterol method. To control for these differences in methods and
instrumentation, the HDL cholesterol was corrected using the Solomon Lab
quality controls as described above. In 2007-2008, a new laboratory performed
the HDL cholesterol using a direct HDL cholesterol method similar to the
direct HDL method of 2005-2006, but it was performed on a different
instrument.  
  
Both laboratories performing HDL Cholesterol from 1999-2008 participated in
the CDC-NHLBI Lipid Standardization Program (LSP). The CDC LSP maximum
allowable bias for HDL Cholesterol is 5%. The average bias compared to the
reference CDC HDL Cholesterol value for 2007-2008 was approximately -0.5%. The
average bias compared to the CDC HDL Cholesterol values for 2003-2004 and
2005-2006 were approximately +2.7% and +2.0%, respectively. Unfortunately, the
HDL Cholesterol values for the LSP program for 1999-2002 could not be
evaluated. This indicates that the 2007-2008 HDL Cholesterol values may be
less biased than the 2003-2006 values; however, both laboratories were within
the 5% maximum allowable bias for HDL Cholesterol.  
  
The changes in average HDL Cholesterol levels from 1999-2008 were seen across
various age, gender and race-ethnicity groups indicating a method effect.
Other covariates (body mass index, medications, physical exercise, smoking and
alcohol consumption) may explain some of the changes in HDL cholesterol, but
it is unlikely to account for the majority of the mean changes in HDL
cholesterol.

## Analytic Notes

**LBXTC:**

The Laboratory 13 data file contains laboratory test results for total
cholesterol (LBXTC), which uses the reference analytic method. However, the
NHANES Laboratory 18 biochemistry profiles also include measurements of total
cholesterol (Laboratory 18 variable name: LBXSCH). In general, for most
analyses, the appropriate variable to use is LBXTC.The value from the
biochemistry profile (LBXSCH) should not be used routinely.

**LBDTCSI:**

The Total cholesterol in mg/dL (LBXTC) was converted to mmol/L (LBDTCSI) by
multiplying by 0.02586.

**LBDHDL:**

HDL-cholesterol was derived from two HDL-cholesterol methods. See analytic
methodology section above.

**LBDHDLSI:**

The HDL-cholesterol in mg/dL (LBDHDL) was converted to mmol/L (LBDHDLSI) by
multiplying by 0.02586.

**Sample Weights**

Use the full sample weight (WTSMEC2YR) and the jackknife replicate sample
weights (WTMREP01-WTMREP52) for serum total cholesterol and high density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol analyses.

The full sample weights are used to estimate means, percentages, medians and
other percentiles, and regression coefficients.

The 52 jackknife replicate weights are used to estimate standard errors of
these statistics.

**Special Notes for this Dataset**

The analysis of NHANES 1999-2000 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 1999-2000
Household Questionnaire data files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during the household
components. The Household Questionnaire data files include all of the survey
design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.
