### DEET and Metabolites (DEET_G)

## Component Description

DEET is a widely used insect repellent, sometimes combined with sunscreen
agents and available for use in concentrations ranging from 4 to 100%. Human
exposure may occur when DEET is absorbed through the skin or inhaled from
aerosol formulations. Because DEET is widely used in the U.S. population,
measuring urinary DEET and its metabolites is important to evaluate human
exposure and potential for health effects.

N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide, commonly known as DEET, is the principal
ingredient in many personal insect repellents worldwide and is highly
effective against a broad spectrum of insect pests, including potential
disease vectors such as mosquitoes, biting flies and ticks (including many
ticks that may carry Lyme disease).  
  
DEET was first developed and patented in 1946 by the U.S. Army for use by
military personnel and later registered for general public use in 1975. Every
year, approximately one-third of the U.S. population uses DEET-containing
insect repellent products with concentrations ranging from 10 to 100% in a
variety of liquids, lotions, gels, sprays, sticks and impregnated materials
and more than 30 million packages of DEET-containing products are sold
annually. Approximately 230 products containing DEET are registered with the
Environmental Protection Agency by about 70 different companies.  
  
Although the clinical relevance of this method, on rare occasions, may extend
to quantifying concentrations for emergency responses, such as accidental
poisonings, its design and intended use is to provide data in support of
epidemiological studies. It does not directly test for any disease.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method uses online solid phase extraction coupled with high performance
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) for
quantifying DEET and two of its metabolites,
N,N-diethyl-3-hydroxymethylbenzamide (DHMB) and 3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic
acid (DCBA), in 100 µL of human urine. Sample preparation begins with an over-
night enzymatic deconjugation of the glucuronide-bound metabolites. On the
second day, the four compounds being measured are concentrated via online SPE
and then chromatographically separated from each other and from other urine
biomolecules using reversed phase HPLC. The eluting molecular ions are
converted to gas phase ions using Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization
(APCI) and then selectively filtered by mass-to-charge ratios at unit
resolution. Select molecular ions are then fragmented with collision induced
dissociation (CID) and the resulting product ions are filtered at unit
resolution before detection via an electron multiplier.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.  
  
There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2011-2012 cycle.

(March 2017)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.  
  
Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
[NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.  
  
The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

DEET and metabolites were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6 years
and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/demo_g.xpt) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).  

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDDEELC indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection. The value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (i.e.,
URDDEELC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]).

The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXDEE) provides the analytic result for
that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ug/L) for DEET and its metabolites are:

**Variable Name** | **  SAS Label** | **  LLOD**

 URXDEE |  N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) (ug/L) |  0.0830  
 URXDEA |  DEET acid (ug/L) |  0.4750  
 URXDHD |  N,N-Desethyl hydroxy benzmde DEET (ug/L) |  0.0890

Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
