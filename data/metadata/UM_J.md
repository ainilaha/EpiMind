### Metals - Urine (UM_J)

####  Data File: UM_J.xpt

##### First Published: July 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Trace metals have been associated with adverse health effects in occupational
studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in general
population groups. This method is used to achieve rapid and accurate
quantifications of multiple elements of toxicological and nutritional
interest. The method is sensitive and rapid enough to analyze urine specimens
from subjects suspected of being exposed to a number of important toxic
elements, or to evaluate environmental or other non-occupational exposure to
these same elements (Thomas, 2013).

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.  Due to disclosure
concern, urine lead data from participants aged 3 to 5 years, as well as urine
strontium and uranium from participants 3 years and older may only be accessed
through the [NCHS Research Data Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/index.htm).
Urine lead data from participants aged 6 years and older, and urine barium,
cadmium, cesium, cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, antimony, thallium, tin, and
tungsten data from all examined participants 3 years and older are included in
this dataset. See Analytic Notes for additional information on urine lead data
from participants aged 3 to 5 years and urine strontium and uranium for
participants 3 years and older.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method directly measures multiple metals in urine specimens using mass
spectrometry after a simple dilution sample preparation step. Liquid samples
are introduced into the mass spectrometer through the inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) ionization source, reduced to small droplets in an argon aerosol
via a nebulizer, and then the droplets enter the ICP. The ions first pass
through a focusing region, followed by the dynamic reaction cell (DRC), the
quadrupole mass filter, and finally are selectively counted in rapid sequence
at the detector allowing individual isotopes of an element to be determined.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Metals -
Urine](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/UM-J-
MET-508.pdf) (August 2021)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
used when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

****The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Variable (WTSA2YR) encoding of the specific sample weights for this
subsample is included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data. These special sample weights were created to account for the
subsample selection probability, as well as the additional nonresponse to
these lab tests. Therefore, if participants were eligible for the subsample,
but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the sample weight value
assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

**** The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-2018
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
Albumin & Creatinine - Urine.

**Detection Limits**

**** The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data
set. Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDUBALC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUBA) provides the analytic
result for that analyte.  For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., URDUBALC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for the urinary metals in the
data set are:

**Variable Name** |  **SAS Label** |  **LLOD**

URXUTL |  Urinary Thallium |  0.018  
URXUSN |  Urinary Tin |  0.09  
URXUTU |  Urinary Tungsten |  0.018  
  
**Data Access**

Urine Lead data for youth aged 3 to 5 years and urine strontium and uranium
for participants 3 years and older are included in file "Metals - Urine
(UM_J_R)", and are available through the [NCHS Research Data
Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/index.htm).
