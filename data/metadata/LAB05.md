### Chlamydia & Gonorrhea - Urine (LAB05)

####  Data File: LAB05.xpt

##### First Published: June 2002

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

  
**Urinary chlamydia and Urinary Gonorrhea**

Sexually transmitted infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria
gonorrhoeae may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy,
infertility, and chronic pelvic pain in women. They are also associated with
increased risk of HIV transmission. Pregnant women may transmit infection to
their newborn causing serious medical complications. At present there are no
reliable estimates on the prevalence of chlamydial and gonococcal infections
in the general population of the United States.

NHANES offers an opportunity to assess the prevalence of chlamydial and
gonococcal infection in the general population and to monitor trends in
prevalence as prevention programs are established and expanded.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 14 to 39 years are tested. The public data file includes
data for persons 18-39 years of age. Please see _Analytic Notes_ about the
availability of data for adolescents 14-17 years of age.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

  
**Data Collection Methods**

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of STD
Prevention Laboratory, National Centers for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and
TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis.  
  
**Examination Protocol**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials were
stored under appropriate frozen (minus 20 degrees Centigrade) conditions until
they were shipped to the Division of STD Prevention Laboratory, National
Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB Prevention, National Center
for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for testing.  
  
**Analytic Methodology**

**Urinary chlamydia**

The Chlamydia trachomatis assay uses LCR TM (ligase chain reaction)
amplification technology in the LCx Probe System for the direct, qualitative
detection of plasmid DNA of Chlamydia trachomatis.

The LCx Chlamydia trachomatis assay uses the nucleic acid amplication method
LCR to detect the presence of C. trachomatis plasmid DNA directly in clinical
specimens. The four oligonucleotide probes in the LCx assay recognize and
hybridize to a specific target sequence within the C. trachomatis plasmid DNA.
The oligonuleotides are  
designed to be complementary to the target sequence so that in the presence of
target, the probes will bind adjacent to one another. They can then be
enzymatically joined to form the amplification product, which subsequently
serves as an additional target sequence during further rounds of amplication.
The product of the LCR reaction is detected on the Abbott LCx analyzer.

**Urinary gonorrhea**

The Neisseria gonorrhoeae assay uses LCR TM (ligase chain reaction)
amplification technology in the LCx Probe System for the direct, qualitative
detection of a specific target nucleic acid sequence in the Opa gene of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae.  
The LCx Neisseria gonorrhoeae assay uses the nucleic acid amplication method
LCR to detect the presence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The four oligonucleotide
probes in the LCx assay recognize and hybridize to a specific target sequence
within the Opa gene of Neisseria gonorrhoeae DNA. The oligonuleotides are
designed to be complementary to the target sequence so that in the presence of
target, the probes will bind adjacent to one another. They can then be
enzymatically joined to form the amplification product which subsequently
serves as an additional target sequence during further rounds of amplication.
The product of the LCR reaction is detected on the Abbott LCx analyzer.

## Analytic Notes

The public release data file includes urinary chlamydia and gonorrhea data for
participants aged 18â39. Data for youth aged 14â17 years are available
through the [NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).
