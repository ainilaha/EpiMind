### Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons -Urine (PAH_F)

####  Data File: PAH_F.xpt

#####  First Published: August 2015

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Urinary  Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**

PAHs constitute a group of chemicals which are formed during the incomplete
combustion of coal, oil and gas, garbage, and other organic substances. In
general, people are exposed to mixtures of PAHs, and the sources are
widespread, including vehicle exhausts, asphalt, coal tar, wild fires,
agricultural burning, charbroiled foods, and tobacco smoke. PAHs enter the
body quickly and easily by all routes of exposure and are readily and
predominantly metabolized to hydroxylated metabolites and glucuronide
metabolites. These compounds require metabolic activation in order to interact
with cellular macromolecules. Measurement of urinary metabolites indicates
exposure to the parent PAHs. Although background ranges of PAHs in air and
water are known, less is known about PAH background levels in humans.

## Eligible Sample

Participants, aged 6 years and older, from a one-third sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The specific analytes measured in this method are monohydroxylated metabolites
of PAHs (OH-PAHs). This procedure involves enzymatic hydrolysis of
glucuronidated/sulfated OH-PAH metabolites in urine, extraction,
derivatization, and analysis using isotope dilution capillary gas
chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Ion transitions specific
to each analyte and carbon-13 labeled internal standards are monitored, and
the abundances of each ion are measured.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2009-2010 cycle.

Refer to the Lab Method File for Monohydroxy Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons.

## Laboratory Method Files

[POLYAROMATIC_HYDROCARBONS_
URINE](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/labmethods/PAH_F_MET_POLYAROMATIC_HYDROCARBONS_URINE.pdf)
(August 2015)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf). Vials
are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2009-2010 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary PAHs were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file. This laboratory data
file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the unique survey
participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (i.e., URD___LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt(2)).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/L) for urinary PAHs is:

Analyte | Item ID | LLOD

Urinary 2-Hydroxyfluorene | URXP04 | 10.0  
Urinary 3-Hydroxyfluorene | URXP03 | 10.0

Urinary 1-Hydroxyphenanthrene | URXP06 | 10.0

Urinary 1-Hydroxynapthalene (1-Naphthol) | URXP01 | 44.0  
Urinary 2-Hydroxynapthalene (2-Naphthol) | URXP02 | 42.0  
Urinary 4-Hydroxyphenanthrene | URXP19 | 10.0  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/nhanes/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
