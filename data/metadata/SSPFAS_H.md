### Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances - Linear and Branched PFOS
and PFOA Isomers (Surplus) (SSPFAS_H)

####  Data File: SSPFAS_H.xpt

##### First Published: July 2016

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. However, survey weights were adjusted. For
each analyte included in this data file, it was determined that overall and
for stratified sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin groups, the updated file
using the new sample weights resulted in an estimate within the 95% confidence
limit calculated using the original file and sample weights. However, not all
possible analyses were performed. For any queries related to this dataset
please email the Biospecimen Program at serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

** _NOTE: These four perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
isomers were analyzed using surplus serum specimens from NHANES 2013-2014.
This dataset should be used in conjunction with the Perfluoroalkyl and
Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS_H) dataset on this website. Starting with
NHANES 2015-2016, these isomers will be included with the perfluoroalkyl and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) dataset._**

Synthesis of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) employed
electrochemical fluorination (ECF) or fluorotelomerization. ECF, used from the
1950s until the early 2000s, yielded branched and linear isomers. By contrast,
fluorotelomerization produces almost exclusively linear compounds (Vyas et al.
2007). The structural isomer patterns of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and
perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in humans may be useful for understanding
routes and sources of exposure (Benskin et al. 2010). Therefore,
concentrations of linear PFOA (n-PFOA), sum of branched isomers of PFOA (Sb-
PFOA, branched PFOA isomers), linear PFOS (n-PFOS), and sum of
perfluoromethylheptane sulfonate isomers (Sm-PFOS, monomethyl branched PFOS
isomers) were measured in serum collected from eligible participants aged 12
years and older from NHANES 2013-2014.

The calculated sum of isomers in the PFAS (formerly PFC) dataset for the
2013-2014 cycle is comparable to the total levels reported in previous cycles
of NHANES.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12+ years from NHANES 2013-2014 with stored serum.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

n-PFOA, Sb-PFOA, n-PFOS, and Sm-PFOS were quantified with on-line solid phase
extraction coupled to isotope dilution-high performance liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry. The PFOS isomers known to be included in Sm-PFOS are
perfluoro-3-methylheptane sulfonate, perfluoro-4-methylheptane sulfonate,
perfluoro-5-methylheptane sulfonate, and perfluoro-6-methylheptane sulfonate.
The PFOA isomers known to be included in Sb-PFOA are
perfluoro-3-methylheptanoic acid, perfluoro-4-methyheptanoic acid,
perfluoro-5-methyheptanoic acid, perfluoro-6-methyheptanoic acid,
perfluoro-4,4-dimethylhexanoic acid, perfluoro-5,5-dimethylhexanoic acid,
perfluoro-3,5-dimethylhexanoic acid, and perfluoro-4,5-dimethylhexanoic acid.

To estimate the total (sum of the isomers measured) concentrations of PFOS and
PFOA for each participant, sum the concentrations of n-PFOA and Sb-PFOA for
PFOA, and those of n-PFOS and Sm-PFOS for PFOS. If the value of one isomer is
less than the limit of detection (LOD), then the imputed value is used. The
imputed value is calculated as the LOD divided by the square root of 2
(Hornung et al. 1990) and imputed values are provided in the NHANES public
release file. If the values of all isomers are reported as less than the LOD,
then the sum will be the sum of each imputed value.

(July 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The analytical measurements were conducted following strict quality
control/quality assurance CLIA guidelines. Along with the study samples, each
analytical run included high- and low-concentration quality control materials
(QCs) and serum blanks to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data. The
concentrations of the high-concentration QCs and the low-concentration QCs,
averaged to obtain one measurement of high-concentration QC and low-
concentration QC for each run, were evaluated using standard statistical
probability rules (Caudill et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all analyses were complete. The data were not edited.

Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2013-2014 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data files using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

Detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each analyte.

The variable name ending in "L" (ex., SDNPFOAL) indicates whether the result
was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at
or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the
limit of detection. For analytes with results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., SDNPFOAL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the results
field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt2).

The other variable prefixed SS (ex., SSNPFOA) provides the analytic result for
each analyte.  

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for the four PFAS isomers are:

**Variable Name** | **SAS Label  ** | **LLOD  **  
---|---|---  
 SSNPFOA  |  Linear perfluorooctanoate (ng/mL) |  0.1  
 SSBPFOA |  Branched isomers of perfluorooctanoate (ng/mL) |  0.1  
 SSNPFOS  |  Linear perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (ng/mL) |  0.1  
 SSMPFOS |  Monomethyl branched isomers of PFOS (ng/mL) |  0.1  
  

**Subsample Weights**

Sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data. Previous versions of this data file included a
sample weight variable (WTSB2YR) but when observations were removed from this
data file, a new sample weight was created, and a new sample weight variable
was added to this data file (WTSSBH2Y). Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
