### Chlamydia - Urine (CHLMDA_H)

####  Data File: CHLMDA_H.xpt

##### First Published: November 2015

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Sexually transmitted infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis may lead to
pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic
pelvic pain in women. They are associated with increased risk of HIV
transmission. Pregnant women may transmit infection to their newborn, causing
serious medical complications.

NHANES offers an opportunity to assess the prevalence of chlamydia in the
general population and to monitor trends in prevalence as prevention programs
are established and expanded.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 14-39 years were eligible. Public data file
includes data for persons aged 18-39 years. Please see _Analytic Notes  _about
the release of data for adolescents aged 14-17 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The BDProbeTec CT Chlamydia trachomatis Amplified DNA Assays are based on the
simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA, using amplification
primers and a fluorescent labeled detector probe. The Strand Displacement
Amplification (SDA) reagents are dried in two separate disposable microwell
strips. The processed sample is added to the Priming Microwell, which contains
the amplification primers, fluorescent labeled detector probe, and other
reagents necessary for amplification. After incubation, the reaction mixture
is transferred to the Amplification Microwell, which contains two enzymes (a
DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) necessary for SDA. The
Amplification Microwells are sealed to prevent contamination and then
incubated in a thermally controlled fluorescent reader which monitors each
reaction for the generation of amplified products.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to equipment, lab methods or lab site.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored and shipped to the Division of STD
Prevention Laboratory, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and
TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis. Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are
discussed in the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM).
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf)
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Division of STD PreventionLaboratory for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [ Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.  
  
Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.  
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of AIDS, STD, and TB Laboratory
Researchâs quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013 \- 2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables  
** The analysis of NHANES 2013 - 2014 laboratory data must be conducted using
the appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The demographics file may be linked to the laboratory data file using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Collaborators may obtain NHANES Adolescent STD Special Use Data file through a
special agreement. The data set is a SAS file containing 2 variables for
examined participants aged 14-17 years. Other interested researchers may use
this file in the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC). The variable descriptors and
variable names are as follows:

Sequence number-Seqn  
Chlamydia result-URXUCL

**Detection Limits  
** Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower LLODs
isnât applicable.

Exam weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
