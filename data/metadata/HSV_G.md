### Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 & Type-2 (HSV_G)

####  Data File: HSV_G.xpt

#####  First Published: November 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

HSV-2 infection is one of the best markers of sexual risk factors leading to
sexually transmitted infections, because: (a) HSV-2 infections are common and,
thus, HSV-2 rates are a measure of sexual risk in the broader population
beyond high risk groups; (b) HSV-2 infection is almost always a result of
sexual transmission and, thus, a specific measure of sexually transmitted
infection; (c) HSV-2 infections are not curable and, thus, HSV-2 risk is not
influenced by health care-seeking factors; and (d) sensitive, specific, and
relatively inexpensive tests for HSV-2 antibody are available. HSV-2 is a very
important marker for monitoring the impact of large national efforts,
motivated by the HIV epidemic, to reduce risky sexual behaviors.

The NHANES laboratory data can be linked to NHANES sexual behavior questions
to assist in the understanding of national trends in HIV and sexually
transmitted diseases. The availability of sexually transmitted infection and
risk factors data in a national sample over time is a unique and invaluable
resource for evaluation of national HIV/STD risk-reduction efforts and for
risk-based modeling of the burden and trends of sexually transmitted
infections.

**Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1)**

Sera from NHANES examinees aged 14-49 were tested for antibody to herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 is a common chronic infection that is the
cause of most oral herpes or cold sores.

**Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2)**

Sera from NHANES examinees aged 14-49 were tested for antibody to herpes
simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted infection and
can be used as a marker for sexual transmission of other infectious agents.
HSV-2 infections are rarely life threatening, but morbidity due to painful
genital ulcerations is significant.

## Eligible Sample

Participants 14-49 years of age who did not meet any of the exclusion criteria
were tested for HSV-1 and HSV-2. The public release data file includes HSV-1
data for persons 14-49 years, and HSV-2 data for persons 18-49 years of age.
Please see _Analytic Notes_ about availability of HSV-2 data for persons 14-17
years of age.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to Emory University,
Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Although extensive antigenic cross-reactivity exists between the two viral
types of herpes, a viral glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) (designated gG-2) and a glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) (designated gG-1) have been identified. Monoclonal antibodies
and affinity chromatography have been used to purify these glycoproteins and
thus provide antigens for type-specific herpes serologic assays. Solid-phase
enzymatic immunodot assays are used to detect antibodies reactive to these
antigens. The purified glycoprotein, gG-1 or gG-2, is adsorbed to the center
of a nitrocellulose disk. The rest of the disk surface is coated with bovine
serum albumin to prevent further nonspecific protein adsorption. Incubation of
test serum with the disk allows specific antibodies, if present, to bind to
the immobilized antigen. After extensive washing to remove non-reactive
antibodies, the bound antibodies are detected by sequential treatment with
peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG and the enzyme substrate (H2O2 with
chromogen 4-chloro-1-naphthol). A positive reaction is demonstrated by the
appearance of a blue dot at the center of the disk. Serum reactive to an
immunodot charged with gG-1 indicates the person being tested has HSV-1
infection. Serum reactive to an immunodot charged with gG-2 indicates the
person being tested has HSV-2 infection.

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found in
the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

## Data Processing and Editing

The analytical methods are described in the _Description of Laboratory
Methodology_ section above.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).



## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/fastqx_g.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Laboratory Results**

The items LBXHE1 and LBXHE2 represent type-specific enzymatic immunodot assay
results.  
The type-specific immunodot assays used to detect antibodies reactive to HSV-1
& HSV-2 antigens in NHANES 2009-2010 are the same assays as those used in
NHANES 1999-2008 and NHANES III. Therefore, HSV-1 and HSV-2 results from these
surveys are identical and comparable for trend analyses.

**Data Access**

The public release data file includes HSV-1 data for participants aged 14-49
and HSV-2 data for participants aged 18-49\. HSV-2 data for youth aged 14-17
years are available through the [NCHS Research Data Center
(RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
