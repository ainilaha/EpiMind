### Metals - Urine (P_UM)

####  Data File: P_UM.xpt

##### First Published: November 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

**Metals**

Trace metals have been associated with adverse health effects in occupational
studies or laboratory studies but have not been monitored in general
population groups. This method is used to achieve rapid and accurate
quantifications of multiple elements of toxicological and nutritional
interest. The method is sensitive and rapid enough to analyze urine specimens
from subjects suspected of being exposed to a number of important toxic
elements, or to evaluate environmental or other non-occupational exposure to
these same elements (Caldwell, 2005).

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample were eligible. Due to disclosure concern, urine lead data
from participants aged 3 to 5 years, as well as urine strontium and uranium
from participants 3 years and older may only be accessed through the [NCHS
Research Data Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/). Urine lead data from
participants aged 6 years and older, and urine barium, cadmium, cesium,
cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, antimony, thallium, tin, and tungsten data from
all examined participants 3 years and older are included in this dataset. See
Analytic Notes for additional information on urine lead data from participants
aged 3 to 5 years and urine strontium and uranium for participants 3 years and
older.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method (Caldwell, 2005) directly measures the barium, cadmium, cesium,
cobalt, manganese, molybdenum, lead, antimony, thallium, tin, tungsten, and
other elemental content of urine specimens using inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) after a simple dilution sample preparation step.
Liquid samples are reduced to small droplets in an argon aerosol via a
nebulizer, and then the droplets enter the ICP where the thermal energy
atomizes the sample and then ionizes the atoms. The ions are pulled into the
mass spectrometer where they are focused through the universal cell technology
(UCT), the quadrupole mass filter, and finally are selectively counted in
rapid sequence at the detector according to their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio.
When detecting cadmium, the UCT is filled with oxygen gas to eliminate
polyatomic interferences. When detecting cobalt, the UCT is filled with helium
gas and operated in a kinetic energy discrimination (KED) mode to eliminate
polyatomic interferences. The UCT is vented to vacuum while detecting the
other elements. Quantification is accomplished by comparing the blank-
subtracted counting rate of the element of interest from a sample, ratioed to
an internal standard, to the counting rate, ratioed to an internal standard,
of blank-subtracted, matrix-matched, external calibrators, tested within the
same analytical run.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used. There was a change to the method between the
2017-2018 and the 2019-March 2020 cycles.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals
(LPMs). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until
they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
used when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**  

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Variable (WTSAPRP) encoding of the specific sample weights for this
subsample is included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data. These special sample weights were created to account for the
subsample selection probability, as well as the additional nonresponse to
these lab tests. Therefore, if participants were eligible for the subsample,
but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the sample weight value
assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017- March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  
  
This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
Albumin & Creatinine - Urine.

**Detection Limits**

The change in methods between the 2017-2018 and 2019-March 2020 cycles
resulted in different lower detection limits between the data obtained in the
2019-March 2020 and those in the 2017-2018 survey cycle. In order to make the
merged dataset compatible the higher detection limit of the two methods for
each analyte was used for both cycles. Two variables are provided for each of
these analytes. The variable name ending in "LC" (ex., URDUBALC) indicates
whether the result was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that
the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex.,
URXUBA) provides the analytic result for that analyte. For analytes with
analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex., URDUBALC=1), an
imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).  
  
The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for the urinary metals in the
present dataset are:  

Variable Name | SAS Label | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URXUBA | Urinary Barium | 0.084  
URXUCD | Urinary Cadmium | 0.055  
URXUCS | Urinary Cesium | 0.130  
URXUCO | Urinary Cobalt | 0.024  
URXUMN | Urinary Manganese | 0.130  
URXUMO | Urinary Molybdenum | 0.80  
URXUPB | Urinary Lead | 0.030  
URXUSB | Urinary Antimony | 0.022  
URXUTL | Urinary Thallium | 0.018  
URXUSN | Urinary Tin | 0.20  
URXUTU | Urinary Tungsten | 0.018  
  
**Data Access**

Urine Lead data for youth aged 3 to 5 years and urine strontium and uranium
for participants 3 years and older are included in file "Lead (Youth),
Strontium, and Uranium - Urine (P_UM_R)", and are available through the [NCHS
Research Data Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).
