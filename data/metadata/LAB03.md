## Component Description

  
**HIV antibody test result**

The estimated prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in
the United States population is an important measure of the extent of the
medical and financial burden the nation faces because of this virus. The
current NHANES and HIV antibody data from NHANES III (1988-94) serve as a
baseline for monitoring the changes in the epidemic over time in the general
population of the United States. In addition to HIV antibody testing in
NHANES, whole-blood samples were collected and stored for future CD4 testing
once the HIV status of the sample was known. This procedure allows CDC to
determine the distribution of CD4 cells in a random sample of HIV-positive
individuals. NHANES is now the only national survey collecting blood on a
population-based sample; therefore, it will be a key element in future
estimates. If the participant refused phlebotomy, but did not refuse the HIV
test, urine was tested for HIV antibody.

**CD4+ T-lymphocytes (helper T cells) and CD8+ T cells (suppressor/inducer T
cells**

HIV infection is characterized by a decrease and, eventually, a depletion of
CD4+ T-lymphocytes (helper T cells). Using immunophenotyping, HIV-positive
blood samples and age-matched controls were tested for the proportion of
lymphocytes that are T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD4+ T cells
(helper T cells), and CD8+ T cells (suppressor/inducer T cells).

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 18-49 years who did not refuse the HIV antibody test and had
a blood sample available for CD4+ testing were considered eligible for
testing.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**HIV antibody test result**

All specimens were tested using the Synthetic Peptide Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA)
(Genetic Systems HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA) for the detection of antibody to
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or type 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2) or both (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Any specimen that reacted in an initial test
was retested in duplicate with the Genetic Systems HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA.
Initially reactive specimens that were reactive in either one or both
duplicates from the repeat testing are referred to as ârepeatedly
reactiveâ. These repeatedly reactive specimens were then tested with a more
specific test, the Cambridge Biotech HIV-1 Western Blot Kit (Calypte
Biomedical Corporation, Rockville, MD).

**CD4+ T-lymphocytes (helper T cells) and CD8+ T cells (suppressor/inducer T
cells**

Whole EDTA anti-coagulated blood stored at â70Â°C from the 31 HIV antibody-
positive participants from NHANES 1999-2004 and 34 age-matched controls were
used.

Enumeration of CD4+ lymphocytes in HIV-positive participants and age-matched
controls was performed on cryopreserved whole blood using the method reported
by Fiebig et. al. (11). Samples were batch-thawed quickly in 8-10 samples per
batch in a 37Â°C water bath and analyzed within 2 hours of set-up. The CD4
cell counts were obtained by using the Becton Dickinson MultiTEST reagent in
TrueCOUNT tubes (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA).
Comparison of this method with CD4 counts calculated from CBC absolute lymph
counts from fresh whole blood X CD4% from the frozen whole blood resulted in a
correlation coefficient of 0.9872.

**1\. Blood assay**

All specimens were tested using the Synthetic Peptide Enzyme Immunoassay (EIA)
(Genetic Systems HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA) for the detection of antibody to
human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or type 2 (HIV-1 or HIV-2) or both (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Redmond, WA). Any specimen that reacted in an initial test
was retested in duplicate with the Genetic Systems HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA.
Initially reactive specimens that were reactive in either one or both
duplicates from the repeat testing are referred to as "repeatedly reactive".
These repeatedly reactive specimens were then tested with a more specific
test, the Cambridge Biotech HIV-1 Western Blot Kit (Calypte Biomedical
Corporation, Rockville, MD).

The combination of electrophoretic separation of complex mixtures of antigens
with the highly sensitive immunoblotting technique has been useful in
characterizing the antigenic profile of HIV-1 and describing the immune
response to this virus in exposed or infected persons.

The Cambridge Biotech HIV-1 Western Blot Kit, when used as directed, will
detect antibodies to HIV-1 when present in human serum or plasma. The position
of bands on the nitrocellulose strips allows this antibody reactivity to be
associated with specific viral antigens.

The Cambridge Biotech HIV-1 Western Blot Kit is manufactured by Calypte
Corporation from HIV-I propagated in an H9/HTLV-IIIb T-lymphocyte cell line.
The partially purified virus is inactivated by treatment with psoralen,
ultraviolet light, and detergent disruption. Specific HIV-1 proteins are
fractionated according to molecular weight by electrophoresis on a
polyacrylamide slab gel in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).

The separated HIV-1 proteins are elecrotransferred from gel to a
nitrocellulose membrane, which is then washed, blocked (to minimize
nonspecific immunoglobulin binding), and packaged. Individual nitrocellulose
strips are incubated with serum or plasma specimens, or controls. During
incubation, if HIV-1 antibodies are present in the specimen, they will bind to
the viral antigens bound to the nitrocellulose strips. The strips are washed
again to remove unbound material.

Visualization of the human immunoglobulins specifically bound to HIV-1
proteins is accomplished in situ by using a series of reactions with goat
anti-human IgG conjugated with biotin, avidin conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (HRP), and the HRP substrate 4-chloro-1-naphthol. If antibodies to
any of the major HIV-1 antigens are present in the specimen in sufficient
concentration, bands corresponding to the position of one or more of the
following HIV-1 proteins (p) or glycoproteins (gp) will be seen on the
nitrocellulose strip: p17, p24, p31, gp41, p51, p66, gp120, gp160 (number
refers to apparent molecular mass in kilodaltons).

**2\. Urine assay**

Eligible individuals who refused phlebotomy or who did not have a sufficient
blood sample for the serum HIV assay but who did not refuse HIV testing had
their urine tested for HIV type 1 antibody using the Calypte HIV-1 Urine EIA.
As with serum, initially reactive samples were retested in duplicate, and all
repeatedly reactive samples were confirmed with a Western blot. The Cambridge
Biotech HIV-1 urine Western Blot kit (Calypte biomedical, Rockville, MD) was
used to confirm positive tests. The specifics of the urine assay are similar
to the blood Western blot (see above).

**Whole-blood CD4+ T cells (helper T cells) and CD8+ T cells
(suppressor/inducer T cells)**

Using immunophenotyping, the NHANES specimens were tested for the proportion
of lymphocytes that are CD4+ T cells (helper T cells) and CD8+ T cells
(suppressor/inducer T cells). This was done by incubating anti-coagulated
whole blood with fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibodies to the various
cellular antigens that identify specific cell populations (phenotypes), then
lysing the blood to remove red blood cells. The antibodies were conjugated to
fluorescent tags that emit light of a certain frequency when excited by a
laser beam. The specimens were analyzed on a flow cytometer to determine the
proportion of lymphocytes of a particular phenotype (that emit light at the
right wavelength).

The TruCount method (MultiTEST 4-color) uses TruCount tubes which contain a
lyophilized pellet containing a known quantity of fluorescent beads. A precise
quantity of whole blood is added to the tubes, and the lymphocytes are stained
with MultiTEST monoclonal antibodies. The absolute count of a full lymphocyte
subset profile (CD3+, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3-CD19+, CD3-CD16/56+) can be
determined in four tubes with Trieste and two tubes with MultiTEST by
calculating the ratio of region events for each subset to bead events using
the BD Biosciences-developed software, Mustiest. The one-tube panel (CD3+ CD4+
and CD3+ CD8+) was done on the NHANES samples.

## Data Processing and Editing

**HIV antibody test result**

Blood and urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division
of AIDS, STD, and TB, National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention,
National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Detailed specimen
collection and processing instructions are discussed in the LPM. Read the
LABDOC file for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical
methods are described in the Description of the Laboratory Methodology
section.

**CD4+ T cells (helper T cells) and CD8+ T cells (suppressor/inducer T
cells)**

Data was received after all the HIV testing was complete. The data on these
results were not edited.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

**CD4+ T cells (helper T cells) and CD8+ T cells (suppressor/inducer T
cells)**

  1. A freshly drawn peripheral whole-blood specimen from a healthy donor was run as a daily quality control with each run of NHANES samples for RBC-lysing control. 
  2. CD-Chex Plus Normal control (Streck Labs #213326) was run using each antibody for precision of absolute counts. 

> Reagent login: when a new batch of reagents (whole-blood control, TruCOUNT
> controls, TruCOUNT tubes and antibodies, CaliBRITE beads, etc.) was
> received, it was logged in on the appropriate reagent record sheet recording
> the batch number, lot number, quantity, expiration date, date received, and
> initials. The batch number was written in red on the reagent vial. When a
> new batch was opened, the date of first use was recorded and an expected
> range of values (Â±) was recorded on the appropriate QC sheet in the
> TruCOUNT QA/QC notebook; a copy of the package insert was placed in the
> TruCOUNT 3-Color and 4-Color QA/QC book. Prior to putting new lots of
> reagents or kits into use, a lot-to-lot reagent check was performed in
> parallel with the current lot in use. These results were recorded on the
> reagent login sheet. If results of the new lot were not within 5% of the
> previous lot, the run was repeated with different specimens and, if still
> out of this range, the lot was not used.

  3. For frozen whole-blood control, a normal whole-blood sample with known values that had been stored in 0.5-ml aliquots at â70oC and tested for CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ counts when freshly collected was used. An aliquot was removed from the freezer, thawed, and tested with each NHANES run.Â 

## Analytic Notes

The serum specimens were first tested by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and
confirmed by Western blot (WB). If the EIA was repeatedly negative, the HIV
antibody result was coded as negative. If the EIA was positive and the WB was
positive, the result was coded as positive. If the EIA was positive or
indeterminate but the WB was negative, the result was coded as negative. If
the EIA was positive or indeterminate but the WB was indeterminate, the result
was coded as indeterminate.

CD4+ counts are only available on HIV-positive samples with available blood
and age-matched controls.
