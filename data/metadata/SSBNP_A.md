### N-terminal Pro-BNP (Surplus) (SSBNP_A)

####  Data File: SSBNP_A.xpt

##### First Published: July 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Sera from stored surplus specimens in the NHANES 1999-2004 cycles were tested
for NT-proBNP.

## Eligible Sample

NHANES participants aged 1 year or older who consented to storing their
samples for future research and had stored samples from 1999-2004.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This stored specimen study was conducted by the Principal Investigator (PI)
Dr. Elizabeth Selvin at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
All measurements were performed during 2018-2020 at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland (Lab Director: Dr. Robert
Christenson).

**NT-proBNP  
**NT-proBNP (Roche Diagnostics) was measured in serum on the Roche Cobas e601
autoanalyzer. The lower and upper limits of detection are (5 pg/ml, 35000
pg/ml).  
  
CVs: 3.1% (low, 46 pg/ml) and 2.7% (high, 32805 pg/ml)  
  
The NT-proBNP result is expressed as pg/ml.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all analyses were complete. The data were not edited.  
Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004 Laboratory Data Overview for
general information on NHANES laboratory data. For information on the stored
specimens, refer to the NHANES Biospecimen Program.

**Detection Limits**  
The detection limits were constant. The variable name ending in "L" (ex.,
SSBNPL) indicates whether the result was either measurable, below the lower
limit of detection (LLOD) or above the upper limit of detection (ULOD): A "0"
value means that the result was measurable. A "1" indicates that the result
was below the LLOD. A "2" indicates that the result was above the ULOD. For
analytic results below the limit of detection (ex., SSBNPL=1), an imputed fill
value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the limit of
detection divided by square root of 2 (LOD/âˆš2).  For analytic results above
the limit of detection (ex., SSBNPL=2), an imputed fill value equal to the
value of the ULOD was placed in the analyte results field.

The variable prefixed SS (ex., SSBNP) provides the analytic result.

An indicator variable (SSPRIS) is included for whether the analyte was
measured in a pristine sample (never thawed): 0=non-pristine; 1=pristine.

The limits of detection (LODs) for NT-proBNP are:

**Variable Name** |  **Description** |  **LODs**  
---|---|---  
SSBNP |  NT-proBNP, pg/ml |  5 pg/ml, 35000 pg/ml  
  
**Variable Name** |  **Description**  
---|---  
SSBNPL |  NT-proBNP comment code  
SSPRIS |  Pristine sample  
  
  

****Subsample Weights****

Sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data (WTSSCB2Y, WTSSCB4Y). Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. These sample
weights are shared with file: "SSCARD_A", which was from the same sample of
survey participants.  
  
The work was funded by a grant (PI: Elizabeth Selvin) received by the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health from the Biomarkers Consortium of
the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH).
