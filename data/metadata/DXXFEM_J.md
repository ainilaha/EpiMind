### Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry - Femur (DXXFEM_J)

####  Data File: DXXFEM_J.xpt

##### First Published: May 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Users of the 2017-2018 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry femur bone data
(DXXFEM_J) are encouraged to read the documentation before accessing the data
file.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most widely accepted method of
measuring bone density due in part to its speed, ease of use, and low
radiation exposure (Baran, 1997; Genant, 1996; Heymfield, 1989; Njeh, 1999).
DXA scans of the proximal femur were administered in the NHANES mobile
examination center (MEC) in 2005 through 2010, 2013-14 and 2017-18.

The femur scans provide bone measurements for the total femur, femoral neck,
trochanter, intertrochanter, and Wardâs triangle. Measurements include:

  * Bone mineral content (BMC) (gm) 
  * Bone area (cm2) 
  * Bone mineral density (BMD) (gm/cm2) 

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 50 years and older were eligible. Pregnant females were
ineligible for the DXA examination. Participants who were excluded from the
DXA examination for reasons other than pregnancy were considered to be
eligible nonrespondents. Reasons for exclusion from the DXA examination were
as follows:

  * Pregnancy (positive urine pregnancy test and/or self-report at the time of the DXA examination). 
  * Self-reported history of radiographic contrast material, such as dyes or barium, in the past 7 days. 
  * Measured weight over 450 pounds (DXA table limitation). 

The left hip was routinely scanned unless the participant self-reported a
fractured left hip, a left hip replacement, or a pin in the left hip. The
right hip was scanned in this situation. Participants were excluded from the
femur scan if they had fractured both hips, had replacements of both hips, or
had pins in both hips.

The variable DXAFMRST indicates the examination status for the femur scan; the
codes for DXAFMRST are as follows:

DXAFMRST â femur scan examination status variable  
1 = Femur scan completed  
2 = Femur scan completed, but all data are invalid  
4 = Femur not scanned, weight > 450 lbs  
5 = Femur not scanned, other reason

The main reason for completed, but invalid, femur scans was panniculus, an
âapronâ or redundant layer of fat tissue at the lowest portion of the
abdominal wall. The âNot scanned, other reasonâ code includes no time to
complete the examination, pregnancy test not completed, and participant
refusal.

## Protocol and Procedure

The 2017-2018 femur scans were acquired on Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam
densitometers (Hologic, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts) using software version
Apex 3.2. The radiation exposure from DXA for the femur scan is extremely low
at less than 20 uSv. All scans in the DXXFEM_J file were analyzed with Hologic
APEX version 4.0 software.

The DXA examinations were administered by trained and certified radiology
technologists. Further details of the DXA examination protocol are documented
in the Body Composition Procedures Manual located on the [NHANES
website](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

A high level of quality control was maintained throughout the DXA data
collection and scan analysis, including a rigorous phantom scanning schedule.

**Monitoring of Field Staff and Densitometers**  
Staff from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the NHANES
data collection contractor monitored technologist acquisition performance
through in-person observations in the field. Retraining sessions were
conducted with the technologists annually and as needed to reinforce correct
techniques and appropriate protocol. In addition, technologist performance
codes were recorded by the NHANES quality control center at Shepherd Research
Lab at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department of
Radiology (2017) and at the University of Hawaii (UH) Cancer Center (2018)
during review of participant scans. The codes documented when the technologist
had deviated from acquisition procedures and where scan quality could have
been improved. The performance codes were tracked for each technologist
individually and a summary was reported to NCHS on a quarterly basis.
Additional feedback on technologist performance was provided by the Shepherd
Research Lab when problems were noted during review of the scans. Constant
communication was maintained throughout the year among the Shepherd Research
Lab, the NCHS, and the data collection contractor regarding any issues that
arose.

Hologic service engineers performed all routine densitometer maintenance and
repairs. Copies of all reports completed by the manufacturerâs service
engineers were sent to the quality control center when the scanners were
serviced or repaired so any changes in measurement as a result of the work
could be assessed.

**Scan Analysis**  
Each participant and phantom scan was reviewed and analyzed by the Shepherd
Lab using standard radiologic techniques and study-specific protocols
developed for the NHANES. The Hologic software, APEX v4.0 (Hologic) was used
to analyze all femur scans acquired in 2017-18. Expert review was conducted by
the Shepherd Research Lab on 100% of analyzed participant scans to verify the
accuracy and consistency of the results.

**Invalidity Codes**  
Invalidity codes were applied by the Shepherd Research Lab to indicate the
reasons femur and spine regions of interest (ROI) could not be analyzed
accurately. The invalidity codes are provided in the data file (see Data
Processing and Editing section for a more detailed description of the
invalidity codes).

**Quality Control Scans**  
The quality control phantoms were scanned according to a predetermined
schedule. The Hologic Anthropomorphic Spine Phantom that traveled with each
MEC was scanned daily as required by the manufacturer to ensure accurate
calibration of the densitometer. The Hologic Femur Phantom was scanned once
each week. A Hologic Spine (HSP-Q96) and a Hologic Block Phantom circulated
among the MECs and were scanned at the start of operations at each survey
site.

The complete phantom scanning schedule is described in the Body Composition
Procedures Manual located on the NHANES website.

In 2017-2018, longitudinal monitoring was conducted through the daily spine
phantom scans as required by the manufacturer and the once weekly femur
phantom scans in order to correct any scanner-related changes in participant
data. The circulating HSP-Q96 and block phantoms, which were scanned at the
start of operations at each site, provided additional data for use in
longitudinal monitoring and cross calibration.

The Shepherd Research Lab used the Cumulative Statistics method (CUSUM) and
the MEC-specific phantom data to determine breaks in the calibration of the
densitometers over the course of the survey (Lu, 1996). No shifting or
drifting of the MEC-specific spine phantom values was found for any of the
three MECs during 2017-2018. Therefore, no corrections to the participant data
were made.

A number of data quality issues were addressed through the quality control
program. Direct feedback, given to the technologists regarding acquisition
problems affecting the quality of the scans, and yearly refresher training,
resulted in improved technologist performance. The rigorous schedule of
quality control scans provided continuous monitoring of machine performance.
The expert review procedures assured that scan analysis was accurate and
consistent.

## Data Processing and Editing

During the editing process, data were reviewed for completeness, consistency,
and outliers. Edits of the data were performed when errors were identified.

**Invalidity Codes**  
Invalidity codes are included in the data file to indicate the reasons femur
regions of interest (ROI) could not be analyzed accurately. Invalidity codes
are applicable to completed scans only (DXAFMRST=1 or 2). If a participant was
not scanned, all invalidity codes are missing.

Values for invalidity code DXXFMBCC (Total femur BMD)

0 = Valid data  
1 = Removable or non-removable objects  
3 = Excessive x-ray ânoiseâ due to obesity  
4 = Body parts out of scan region  
5 = Positioning problem  
6 = Other (includes panniculus, participant motion, unknown artifacts)

The total femur BMD was coded as invalid (DXXFMBCC = 1-6) and all femur data
set to missing if data for any femur sub region was invalid. Specifically,
validity codes were provided for the femoral neck and trochanter by the
quality control center because these are the femur regions that have been used
the most in clinical situations. However, if either of these regions was
invalid, the intertrochanter and Ward's triangle were also considered invalid.
The 2007 Official Positions of the International Society for Clinical
Densitometry (ISCD) state that only the femoral neck or total femur regions of
interest should be used for diagnosis of osteoporosis at the femur (2007 ISCD
Official Positions).

## Analytic Notes

The NHANES examination sample weights should be used for any analyses using
the DXXFEM_J data. Please refer to the [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)on the [NHANES
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) for further details on the
use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
