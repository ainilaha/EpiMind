# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2017-March 2020 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Diet Behavior & Nutrition (P_DBQ)

####  Data File: P_DBQ.xpt

##### First Published: October 2021

##### Last Revised: December 2021

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

The Diet Behavior and Nutrition questionnaire (variable name prefix DBQ)
provides personal interview data on various dietary behavior and nutrition
related topics. Many of the questions were included in NHANES II (1976-80),
Hispanic HANES (1982-84), NHANES III (1988-94), and NHANES 1999-2016. Topics
included in the DBQ are:

  * Breastfeeding and other childhood feeding practices (≤ 6 years); 
  * Current milk consumption pattern and types of milk (≥ 1 year); 
  * Milk consumption pattern throughout life span (≥ 20 years); 
  * Community or government meal program participation for seniors  (≥ 60 years); 
  * School meal program participation (4-19 years); 
  * Self-appraised healthfulness level of one's own diet (≥ 16 years); 
  * Frequency of getting meals prepared away from home (≥ 1 year); 
  * Frequency of meals gotten from fast-food or pizza places (≥ 1 year); 
  * Use of convenience foods (≥ 1 year); 
  * Awareness of My Plate program (≥ 16 years); and
  * Meal planner/shopper/preparer status (≥ 16 years). 

Information on individual participant's food choices, such as getting meals
prepared away from home, meals from fast-food or pizza places, use of
convenience foods or ready-to-eat meals bought in stores, and the
participant's awareness of the My Plate program as well as his/her meal
planner/shopper/preparer status at home in the DBQ section were collected as
part of the core set of the Flexible Consumer Behavior Survey (FCBS) module.
The FCBS module has been included in NHANES since 2007, and was developed in
collaboration with the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the U.S. Department
of Agriculture (USDA). It is designed to collect information on people's
knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs toward nutrition and food choices. The FCBS
module has two elements: a core set of questions asked during the NHANES
household interview, and a supplementary module asked as a telephone follow-up
interview with focuses specifically designed for each 2-year data collection
cycle.

In addition to questions included in the DBQ section, the core set of
questions for the FCBS module collected in the 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 survey
cycles also included questions at the participant's family level. For example,
family monthly income and family assets, food expenditures, as well as the
family's participation on federal food assistance programs. The family food
expenditures data are included in the Consumer Behavior (CBQ) section, while
the monthly income and family assets data are included in the Income (INQ)
section, and food program participation data are included in the Food Security
(FSQ) section.

Data from the phone follow-up FCBS supplementary module are to be released in
separate files and made available on the NHANES website as well. Similar to
other datasets created from the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample,
all FCBS related data files can be linked by the respondent sequence number
(SEQN). For more information on the other FCBS related data, refer to the
documentation accompanying the datasets.

## Eligible Sample

All participants in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were
eligible. The target age groups for individual questions in this section vary
by the topic. For example, the questions pertaining to infant nutrition and
breastfeeding were asked of proxy respondents for children 6 years of age and
younger; and senior meal program participation questions were asked of
respondents 60 years of age and older. Please review the questionnaire and
codebook carefully. Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of
the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

Questions on the frequencies of getting meals prepared away from home
(DBD895), meals from fast-food or pizza places (DBD900), and use of
convenience foods (DBD905 and DBD910) were answered by participants 12-15
years old, at the mobile examination center (MEC), using the Audio Computer
Assisted Self-Interview (ACASI) system. The same questions were asked of
participants 1-11 years and of participants 16 years and older, in the home,
by trained interviewers using the Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI)
system. All other questions in this section were asked in the home, as well.

Hand cards showing response categories were also used for some questions. When
necessary, the interviewers read the hand cards to respondents. Persons 16
years of age and older and emancipated minors were interviewed directly. A
proxy provided information for survey participants who were under 16 years of
age and for individuals who could not answer the questions themselves.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. All data was reviewed by the
NHANES field office staff for accuracy and completeness.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of question responses was reviewed. Edits were made to some
variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic usefulness of
the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to address data disclosure
concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing
process, the third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e.,
DBQ) to a D (i.e., DBD). For example, some data were collected using two
variables (a number variable and a unit of measure variable) but combined into
a single variable for data release purposes.

**DBD020, DBD030, DBD041, DBD050, DBD055, and DBD061** (Breastfeeding and
other childhood feeding practices)  
This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to
allow respondents to report the age of interest in days, weeks, months, or
years. The released variables were edited to standardize the reported age to
number of days, using the following conversion factors: 7 days/week, 30.4
days/month and 365 days/year. If the age for the time stopped breastfeeding
(DBD030), or stopped receiving formula (DBD050), or first fed milk (DBD060)
was reported as older than 1095 days (3 years), the value was re-coded as
"666666." Similarly, if the age for the time first fed formula (DBD041) was
reported as older than 365 days (1 year), or the age for the time started
other food/beverage than breastmilk/formula was reported as older than 730
days (2 years), the value was re-coded as "666666" as well.

**DBD895** (Frequency of getting meals prepared away from home)  
Respondents were asked how many times they had gotten meals that were prepared
away from home in the past 7 days. If the frequency was reported as "never,"
the value was re-coded as "0." If the frequency was reported more than 21
times per week, the value was re-coded as "5555."

**DBD900** (Frequency of getting meals from fast food or pizza places)  
Respondents were asked how many times they had gotten meals from fast food or
pizza places in the past 7 days. If the frequency was reported as "never," the
value was re-coded as "0." If the frequency was reported more than 21 times
per week, the value was re-coded as "5555."

**DBD905 and DBD910** (Use of convenience foods)  
This information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions to
allow respondents to report the frequency of interest as either per day, per
week, or per month. The released variables were edited to standardize the
reported frequency to number of times in the last 30 days. If the frequency
was reported as "never," the value was re-coded as "0." If the frequency was
reported more than 90 times in the last 30 days, the value was re-coded as
"6666."

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate
for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

**DBD895, DBD900, DBD905, and DBD910**(Frequency of getting meals prepared
away from home, frequency of meals got from fast-food or pizza places, and use
of convenience foods)  
These questions were asked as part of household interview for participants
1-11 (proxy interview used) and 16 or more years of age, the interview sample
weights may be used in their analysis. However, if the data is joined with
other data from the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), the exam sample weights
should be used. Analysis of these questions for participants 12-15 years old
should use the exam sample weights because the questions were asked in the MEC
for this age group.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. Both are
available on the NHANES website.
