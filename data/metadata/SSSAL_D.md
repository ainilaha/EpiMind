### Salmonella & Campylobacter Antibodies (Surplus) (SSSAL_D)

####  Data File: SSSAL_D.xpt

##### First Published: January 2015

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at
serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

Among adults aged 20-64 years, randomly selected, who participated in NHANES
between 2005 and 2006 and had stored serum samples available, Salmonella and
Campylobacter antibody testing was conducted. IgG, IgA and IgM antibodies were
measured using enzyme immunoassays.

## Eligible Sample

Surplus sera from adults aged 20-64 years who participated in NHANES years
2005 to 2006.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

25μL of sample is required for each assay. Specimens, calibrators and controls
are pre-diluted 1:200 prior to placing them in the test wells. Cut-off
calibrator, controls and subject samples are diluted in PBS with 1% Bovine
serum albumin, mixed briefly by vortex to assure good distribution of the
sample in the diluent, and then transferred to the test plate by a Biomek NXP
robot prior to incubation. After washing the wells, conjugate is added with
another incubation and wash step following. Substrate is added and allowed to
incubate before the addition of stop/color reagent. The plates are read at an
absorbance of 405 nm using a reference wavelength of 540 nm.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were submitted after all the antibody testing was complete. The data were
not edited.

Data Access: All data will be publicly available.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Commercial alkaline phosphatase conjugates were used for the anti IgA and IgM
antibody testing. CDC produced monoclonal antibody HP 6043 with a alkaline
phosphastase conjugate was used for anti IgG antibody detection. All QA/QC
procedures recommended by the manufacturer were followed. NHANES serum was
tested in quadruplicate, and accepted if the standard deviation was less than
0.200. Serum results with a high standard deviation were retested if after a
outlying value was excluded, the standard deviation was still over 0.200.

## Analytic Notes

The EIA indices have yet to be determined. Preliminary laboratory evaluations
using the MedCalc™ ROC curve analysis software has been performed. The indices
are considered to be tentative pending a formal evaluation by Enteric Diseases
Epidemiology Branch statisticians.  
_Salmonella_ IgA positive value: .323  
_Salmonella_ IgG positive value: .446  
_Salmonella_ IgM positive value: .222  
_Campylobacter_ IgA positive value: .481  
_Campylobacter_ IgG positive value: .229  
_Campylobacter_ IgM positive value: .375  
Analysis and mathematical modeling of the NHANES serum results are awaiting
the final statistical analysis of the validation data.
