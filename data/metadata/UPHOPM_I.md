### Pyrethroids, Herbicides, & Organophosphorus Metabolites (UPHOPM_I)

####  Data File: UPHOPM_I.xpt

##### First Published: May 2023

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

In 2012, an estimated 854 million pounds of conventional pesticides were used
in the United States (EPA, 2017). Chlorpyrifos was the insecticide used the
most in the agricultural market sector with 4-8 million pounds applied. 2,4-D
was the most used herbicide in the home and garden sector and second most used
in the commercial sector, and it was the fourth most used herbicide in the
agricultural sector. Pyrethroids were the most used insecticides in the home
and garden sector. In 2012, the United States used 24% of all pesticides
applied throughout the world. The widespread use of pesticides and the
scientific interest in potential adverse health effects of pesticides exposure
have increased the demand for fast and robust analytical methods for measuring
biomarkers of pesticides.

This component measures urinary concentrations of four organophosphorus
insecticide metabolites: 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol,
2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidiol, para-nitrophenol, and
2-[(dimethoxyphosphorothioyl) sulfanyl] succinic acid; three synthetic
pyrethroid metabolites: 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid,
and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid;
and one herbicide: 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Target analytes are extracted and concentrated from the urine matrix using an
automated solid phase extraction system. Selective separation of the analytes
is achieved using high-performance liquid chromatography with a gradient
elution program. Sensitive detection of the analytes is performed by a triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer with a heated electrospray ionization source.
Analytes are identified using the specific m/z ion transition, the retention
time and the ion ratio of the quantification and confirmation m/z ion
transitions. Isotopically labeled internal standards are used for precise and
accurate quantification. The approach followed is a modification of previous
methodology (Beeson et. al., 1999; Olsson et. al., 2004).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, and lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle. URXMAL Malathion Diacid was a new
component in the 2015-2016 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

The method file will be available soon.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they were
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Services' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the[ 2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Pyrethroids, Herbicides, & Organophosphorus Metabolites were measured in a
one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights
are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

The analytes included in this dataset were measured for all examined
participants aged 3 to 5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. For participants aged 3 to 5, their WTSBSYR is equivalent to
their MEC exam sample weights. These participants have completed at least one
physical exam component in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample
weight larger than "0", regardless of their lab test results. For participants
6 years and older, special sample weights were created for the subsample.
These special weights accounted for the additional probability of selection in
to the subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if participants 6 years and older were selected as part of the one-
third subsample, but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the
sample weight value assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit were constant for all of the analyte in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in
"LC" (ex., URD24DLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed URX (ex., URX24D) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URD24DLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ug/L) for Pyrethroids, Herbicides, &
Organophosphorus Metabolites - Urine:

Variable Name | Analyte Description | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URX24D | 2,4-dicholorphenoxyacetic acid | 0.15  
URXCPM | 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol | 0.10  
URX4FP | 4-fluoro-3-phenoxy-benzoic acid | 0.10  
URXOPM | 3-phenoxybenzoic acid | 0.10  
URXOXY | 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-pyrimidinol | 0.10  
URXPAR | _para_ -Nitrophenol | 0.10  
URXTCC | _trans_ -dichlorovinyl dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid | 0.60  
URXMAL | Malathion diacid | 0.50
