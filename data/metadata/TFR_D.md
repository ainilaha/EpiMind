## 2005-2006 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Transferrin Receptor (TFR_D)

####  Data File: TFR_D.xpt

#####  First Published: April 2008

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are:

  1. to provide data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 
  2. to evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status; and 
  3. to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. 

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 1-5 years both genders and females 12 to 49 years who do not
meet any of the exclusion criteria are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Transferrin Receptor**

The method for measurement of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is immuno-
turbidimetry using Roche kits on the Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer. Latex
bound anti-sTfR antibodies react with the antigen in the sample to form an
antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, this is measured
turbidimetrically.

## Data Processing and Editing

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found at
NHANES web page.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found at NHANES web site.

## Analytic Notes

**General Analytical Note:**

The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2005-2006
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Household Questionnaire Data Files also contain all survey
design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
