####  Data File: P_HSCRP.xpt

##### First Published: August 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein synthesized in the liver.
It is involved in the activation of complement, enhancement of phagocytosis,
and detoxification of substances released from damaged tissue. It is one of
the most sensitive, though nonspecific, indicators of inflammation. CRP levels
may rise within six hours of an inflammatory stimulus. Measurement of CRP
concentrations by this highly sensitive method is performed primarily to
ascertain the level of cardiovascular disease risk in individuals who have no
existing inflammatory conditions. Increases in CRP concentration are non-
specific and should be used in conjunction with traditional clinical
laboratory evaluation of acute coronary syndromes.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 1 year and older, in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample, were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This is a two-reagent, immunoturbidimetric system. The specimen is first
combined with a Tris buffer, then incubated. The second reagent (latex
particles coated with mouse anti-human CRP antibodies) is then added. In the
presence of circulating CRP the latex particles aggregate, forming immune
complexes. These complexes cause an increase in light scattering that is
proportional to the CRP concentration. The light absorbance resulting from
this light scatter is read against a stored CRP standard curve. The
concentration of CRP is determined from this line. Turbidity is measured at a
primary wavelength of 546 nm (secondary wavelength 800 nm).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the University of
Minnesota - Advanced Research Diagnostics Laboratory (ARDL), Minneapolis, MN
for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures Manuals
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-
Procedures-Manual-508.pdf)(LPMs). Vials were stored under appropriate frozen
(-30Â°C) conditions until they were shipped to the University of Minnesota for
testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al., 1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate
for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Refer to the [2017-2018
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)and
[2019-2020 Laboratory Data Overview
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)documents
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017 - March 2020, approximately
76% of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-March 2020 Pre-
pandemic
DemographicsFile](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [2017-March 2020 Pre-pandemic Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit was constant for the analyte in the data set. Two
variables are provided for this analyte. The variable name ending in "LC"
(ex., LBDHRPLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of detection,
"1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For the
analyte with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (LBDHRPLC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The
variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXHSCRP) provides the analytic result for that
analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in mg/L) for High-Sensitivity C-Reactive
Protein:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXHSCRP |  High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (mg/L) |  0.15
