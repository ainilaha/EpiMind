## Component Description

Urinary albumin and creatinine are measured. Related survey questionnaire data
include information on analgesic product use and incontinence.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Data Collection Methods**

A casual urine specimen is collected from the participant. In the laboratory,
the urine specimen is processed, stored, and shipped to the University of
Minnesota for analysis.

**Examination Protocol**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials were
stored under appropriate frozen (-20 degrees Centigrade) conditions until they
were shipped to University of Minnesota for testing. The analytical methods
are described in the Analytic methodology section.

**Analytic Methodology**

**Urinary Creatinine**

Creatinine analysis uses a Jaffe rate reaction, in which creatinine reacts
with picrate in an alkaline solution to form a red creatinine-picrate complex.
The reaction is measured with a CX3 analyzer. The rate of the color
development is measured 25.6 sec after sample injection at 520 nm and at 560
nm. The rate difference between the two wavelengths is proportional to the
concentration of creatinine in the reaction cup. The procedures described
below are the standard protocols of the Fairview University Medical Center
(FUMC)1,2,3,4,5.

Creatinine, the waste product derived from creatine, is released into the
plasma at a relatively constant rate. The amount of creatinine per unit of
muscle mass is constant; therefore, creatinine is the best indicator of
impaired kidney function.

**Urinary Albumin**

A solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay for the measurement of human urinary
albumin is described by Chavers et al.6. The fluorescent immunoassay is a non-
competitive, double-antibody method for the determination of human albumin in  
urine. Antibody to human albumin is covalently attached to derivatized
polyacrylamide beads. The solid-phase antibody is reacted with a urine
specimen. The urine albumin-antigen complexes with the solid-phase antibody.
This complex then reacts with fluorescein-labeled antibody. Remove the
unattached fluorescent antibody by washing during centrifugation. Determine
the fluorescence of the stable solid-phase antibody complex with a
fluorometer. The fluorescence is directly proportional to the amount of urine
albumin present. The standard curve is 0.5-20 μg/mL albumin.

Increased microalbuminuria is a sign of renal disease and may be predictive of
nephropathy risk in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Results of the
fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) are reproducible, and the test is accurate and
sensitive for the detection of human urinary albumin excretion. It is
especially useful for measurement of low levels of urinary albumin not
detectable by dipstick methods. The FIA assay resembles the radio-immunoassay
(RIA) in technique and sensitivity without the potential health hazards
associated with the handling of isotopes in the laboratory6.
