## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP; also called orosomucoid) is synthesized in the
liver and structurally belongs to the lipocalin superfamily of secretory
proteins, such as retinol-binding protein and α1-microglobulin. It is made up
of a polypeptide chain having 5 carbohydrate chains N-glycosidically bonded to
it (molar mass of 41,000 daltons).

AGP is a sensitive acute phase reactant and its concentration can increase by
a factor of 3 within 24-48 hours when inflammation occurs. It can also be used
to differentiate between acute phase reactions (elevated serum level) and
estrogen effects (normal or decreased serum level); whereas, the serum level
of other positive reactants, such as ceruloplasmin and haptoglobin, increases
during such reactions. Moderate and isolated increases occur when glomerular
filtration is inhibited in the early stages of uremia. The determination is
used in the assessment of the activity of acute and recurring inflammations as
well as of tumors with cell necrosis (Schmid, 1975).

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 3-5 years and females aged 12-49 years were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The Tina-quant Roche AAGP2 assay is based on the principle of immunological
agglutination. Anti-α1-acid glycoprotein antibodies react with antigen in the
sample to form an antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, this is
measured turbidimetrically (AAGP2 Tina-quant α1-Acid Glycoprotein Gen.2
[package insert]).

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 cycle.  

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The laboratory and method were certified according to the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendment (1988) guidelines (Clinical Laboratory Improvement
Amendment, 1988). Either in-house prepared serum quality control (QC) pools at
three levels or Roche QC pools at two levels were analyzed in every run in
duplicate and evaluated for validity against pre-established means and control
limits by use of a multi-rule quality control program (Caudill et. al., 2008).

Performance of QC pools during the study period:

QC Pool | Analyte | n | Mean (g/L) | SD (g/L) | CV (%) | Difference to target (%)  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
LS17523_b | AGP | 24 | 0.517 | 0.02 | 4.5 | -0.81  
LS17523_c | AGP | 37 | 0.516 | 0.03 | 4.9 | 0.60  
MS17524_b | AGP | 24 | 0.954 | 0.03 | 3.3 | -0.56  
MS17524_c | AGP | 37 | 0.939 | 0.02 | 2.5 | 0.45  
HS17525_b | AGP | 24 | 2.064 | 0.03 | 1.5 | -0.63  
HS17525_c | AGP | 37 | 2.026 | 0.04 | 1.8 | -0.52  
PNP_50538700 | AGP | 12 | 0.681 | 0.03 | 4.0 | -0.87  
PPP_50539400 | AGP | 12 | 1.299 | 0.03 | 2.0 | -5.87  
PNP_59413100 | AGP | 26 | 0.668 | 0.03 | 4.0 | -4.57  
PPP_59413200 | AGP | 26 | 1.237 | 0.03 | 2.2 | -4.85  
  
The method achieved satisfactory performance using the Institute for Reference
Materials and Measurements (IRMM) lyophilized human serum reference material
ERM-DA470k, which has a certified AGP value of 0.617 g/L as measured by
various methods using ERM-D470 as calibrant. The mean recovery of AGP in ERM-
DA470k spiked into CFAS protein material was 91.5% (1:2 dilution), 93.2% (1:4
dilution), and 91.3% (1:8 dilution) during 9 measurements performed between
2020 and 2023. When averaged across dilutions, the mean recovery by year was
96.6% (2020), 91.5% (2021), 87.7% (2022), and 95.6% (2023). This procedure was
adopted to avoid matrix effects that were observed when the reference material
was diluted with Roche diluent, saline, or water and showed significant under-
recovery.

The current project did not use pristine (never thawed) samples, because the
laboratory showed that multiple freeze/thawing cycles do not cause a
noticeable loss of AGP; and AGP can be assessed in residual serum as long as
the specimens have been stored frozen at -70C.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all the laboratory testing was complete. The data
were not edited for extreme values.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from surplus specimens from
the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data
file. A special weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in the present file should be
used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are
not appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not
yield nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or
the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for
additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and
for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that
2-year cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data
Overviews](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. Additionally, availability of specimens for surplus projects
is lower than for other laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The
specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)for
details on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in a participants aged 3-5
years and females aged 12-49 years. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample,
WTSSAGPP, are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data. The sample weights created for this file used the examination
sample weight, i.e., WTMECPRP, as the base weight. The base weight was
adjusted for additional nonresponse to these lab tests and re-poststratified
to the population total using sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin. Participants
who were part of the eligible population but who did not provide a serum
specimen, or did not have sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not
give consent for their specimens to be used for future research are included
in the file, but they have a sample weight assigned "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set. No
results were below the lower limit of detection. The lower limit of detection
(LLOD in g/L) for SSAGP:

Variable Name | Analyte Name | LLOD  
---|---|---  
SSAGP | Alpha-1-Acid Glycoprotein (g/L) | 0.1
