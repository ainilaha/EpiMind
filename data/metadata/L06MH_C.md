### Methylmalonic acid & Homocysteine (L06MH_C)

####  Data File: L06MH_C.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2006

#####  Last Revised: July 2007

## Component Description

Methylmalonic acid and Homocysteine

The objectives of this component are:

  1. to provide data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 
  2. to evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status; and 
  3. to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. 

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

**Methylmalonic acid and Homocysteine**

Participants aged 3 year and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Methylmalonic acid**

Methylmalonic acid (MMA) is extracted from plasma along with an added internal
standard using an anion exchange resin. The extracted acid is then derivatized
with cyclohexanol to form a dicyclohexyl ester. The derivatized samples are
injected onto a gas chromatograph for separation from other constituents. The
effluent from the gas chromatograph is monitored with a mass selective
detector using selected ion monitoring. Results are quantitated by internal
calibration using peak area ratios of MMA and the internal standard (d3MMA).

Increased concentrations of methylmalonic acid in plasma or serum and
excessive urinary excretion of MMA are believed to be direct measures of
tissue stores of cobalamin (vitamin B12) and to be the first indication of
cobalamin deficiency. The concentration of MMA in plasma or serum was found to
be a useful indicator of cobalamin deficiency, especially in patients with few
or no hematological abnormalities, normal results for the Schilling test, or
normal or only slightly depressed serum cobalamin concentrations. In folate
deficiency, methylmalonic acid is normal. Methylmalonic acid may be elevated
due to inborn errors of metabolism.

The range of methylmalonic acid in plasma from "healthy adults" is 0.05 to
0.26 umol/L.  
An international round robin performed in 1999 demonstrated that this method
is fully equivalent to the original method of Rasmussen, but also to the
method of Marcell et al..

**Homocysteine**

The method is a fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) from Abbott
Diagnostics. Total homocysteine (tHcy) in plasma is measured by the Abbott
Homocysteine assay on the Abbott AxSym analyzer, a fully automated FPIA
method. DTT reduces homocysteine bound to albumin and to other small
molecules, homocysteine, and mixed disulfides, to free thiol.
S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase catalyzes conversion of homocysteine to
SAH in the presence of added adenosine. The specific monoclonal antibody and
the fluoresceinated SAH analog tracer constitute the FPIA detection system.
Plasma total homocysteine concentrations are calculated by the Abbott AxSym
Immunoassay Analyzer using a machine-stored calibration curve.

As part of ongoing methods comparisons studies, an international round robin
was conducted in 1998. Results obtained using the FPIA method described
earlier were compared to results obtained using high performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) with fluorometric detection at 385 nm excitation and 515
nm emission. The international round robin demonstrated that the FPIA method
was fully equivalent to other frequently used methods (i.e., HPLC-FD, HPLC-ED,
and GC/MS). Thus, the Abbott Homocysteine assay was used as the primary method
for determination of plasma total homocysteine in NHANES 2003-2004.

## Data Processing and Editing

Plasma specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

This file contains no top coding.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables.

The NHANES 2003-2004 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic
data, health indicators, and other related information collected during
household interviews. The Household Questionnaire Data Files also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

Homocysteine method change:

The Homocsteine (uMol/L) method changed in 2002 from an Abbott IMX to an
Abbott AxSym method. A crossover study was performed and revealed the
following Deming regression (n=361, r**2 = 0.9817):

AxSym = 10**(0.983*log10(IMX) + 0.0418)
