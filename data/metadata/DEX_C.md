## Component Description

One in three Americans has a skin condition serious enough to require medical
attention. However, there are major gaps in knowledge about the frequency,
impact, etiology and prevention of most skin diseases.  
Psoriasis affects the health related quality of life in ways similar to other
major medical conditions. Studies of disability caused by psoriasis, such as
arthritis, indicate that level of disability for those with the condition are
greater than that of healthy controls. There is also an association between
psoriasis and stress, as well as depression.

Hand dermatitis is the most common occupational skin disease, as well as a
common cause of occupational disability. Acute eczematous dermatitis is one of
the few skin diseases that, according to Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990, may still be used as a reason for exclusion fromemployment. The
estimated cost associated with this condition is greater than $300 million
dollars a year.

The Fitzpatrick skin type is a method of classifying individuals based on
their response to sun exposure in terms of tanning and burning
(photosensitivity) (Fitzpatrick, 1988).

Fitzpatrick Classification of Skin Type  
I - Always burns, never tans (pale white skin)  
II - Always burns easily, tans minimally (white skin)  
III - Burns moderately, tans uniformly (light brown skin)  
IV - Burns minimally, always tans well (moderate brown skin)  
V - Rarely burns, tans profusely (dark brown skin)  
VI - Never burns, (deeply pigmented dark brown to black skin)

Individuals' susceptibility to different skin conditions and diseases is known
to vary by skin type. Currently, the distribution of skin type across the U.S.
population is unknown. Knowing more about the U.S distribution of skin type
will be helpful in developing more accurate measures of risk factors for
various skin conditions and diseases. It may also be important to the
development of better national health education campaigns regarding sun
protective behavior.

## Eligible Sample

Sample persons aged 20-59 years who do not meet any of the exclusion criteria.

Exclusion Criteria:

A person using a wheelchair did not receive the photos of the back or back of
the legs. He/she would be eligible for the other photos. There are no safety
exclusions for this component.

## Protocol and Procedure

Protocol:

The exam consists of four digital images taken by a health technician using a
Kodak DCS760 digital camera with a 50mm lens. The poses were as follows:

"BACK with ELBOWS"

![picture of persons back and
elbows](/NCHS/NHANES/2003-2004/DEX_C/back_elbows.bmp)

  * Back of gown is opened and clipped to expose subject's back. 
  * Sticky rule is placed on subject's back. 
  * Arms are rotated out to square up the elbows. 
  * Top of shot at subject's neck (no head). 
  * Camera focus indicator is on subject's spine. 

"INNER ARM"

![picture of person's inner arm](/NCHS/NHANES/2003-2004/DEX_C/inner_arm.bmp)

  * Subject's gown is closed and they are instructed to turn around and face the camera. 
  * Subject extends the left arm to the left side, with palm up. 
  * Top of shot is Subject's neck (no head). 

"FRONT OF LEGS with HANDS"

![picture of person's legs and
hands](/NCHS/NHANES/2003-2004/DEX_C/legs_hands.bmp)

  * Subject is instructed to face the camera. 
  * Subject places hands on lower abdomen, with fingers extended, for tops of hands. 
  * Bottom of shot is just below subject's ankles. 
  * Camera focus indicator is on back of subject's Gown. 

"BACK OF LEGS with PALMS"

 ![picture of person's legs and
palms](/NCHS/NHANES/2003-2004/DEX_C/legs_palms.bmp)

  * Subject's back is to the camera. 
  * Subject places hands behind back on lower hips, with palms flattened and fingers spread. 
  * Bottom of shot is just below subject's ankles. 
  * Camera focus indicator is on back of subject's gown 

In addition, the readers made an assessment of image quality. They evaluated
the image on the following criteria - focus, shadows, positioning of subject,
and "other". The other category allowed readers to identify difficulties with
the image for reasons other than those listed above.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

All data from each of the sections of the Dermatology Examination Component
were directly entered by MEC technicians into ISIS, a computerized database
information system. Health technicians in the Mobile Examination Centers were
trained in the protocol by expert consultants in digital photography. In
addition, Dermatology consultants from the NIH/National Institute of Arthritis
and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease (NIAMS) and contractor staff provided
performance monitoring of each Health technician on a regular, periodic basis.
Additionally, NCHS staff visited the MECs approximately twice per year per
examination team to observe the Dermatology examinations and verify that
standard testing procedures were being strictly followed by technicians. All
MEC Dermatology technicians also received annual retraining and updates by the
NIAMS consultants. Finally, exclusion rates and outcome statistics were
continually monitored by NCHS according to technician and MEC, and retraining
was conducted as necessary to maintain test quality.

For details on the QA/QC process for this component, please refer to the
Interviewer Procedure Manuals on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

All data were captured in ISIS, a computerizeddatabase. NCHS performed data
reviews on an ongoing basis using a computerized data editing program to check
for logical inconsistencies in the data and technician errors, as well as to
check other issues affecting data quality. Back-end edits of the data were
performed as necessary where errors were detected. The 2003-2004 Dermatology
Examination data were reviewed for errors and logical consistency and verified
against the primary examination data database prior to public data release.

## Analytic Notes

Because the NHANES 2003-2004 Dermatology examination was administered in the
MEC, the full sample MEC examination sample weight should be used for data
analysis. For information on the use of sample weights in NHANES data
analysis, refer to the NHANES 1999-2000 and 2003-2004 Addendum to the NHANES
III Analytic Guidelines. NHANES 2003-2004 dermatology data was collected for a
full sample of U.S. adults ages 20-59.

The dermatology digital images were read by two separate dermatologists. When
the finding of the two readers disagreed, the image reading software program
required a third consensus reading. For the consensus readings, both
dermatologists reviewed the image for findings at the same time and came to a
unified decision. The variable names for data based on Reader 1 contains the
number 1 (DEX1, DEA1, etc.). Findings from Reader 2 contain the number 2 in
the variable name (DEX2, DEA2, etc.) Variable names for the consensus reading
assessments contain the number 6 (DEX6, DEA6,etc.). The algorithm used for
consensus readings is given below:

**Consensus Rules**

Rule 1:

Sample person (SP) images go to consensus if the two readings for Hand
Dermatitis are not on the list of acceptable combinations:

Hand Dermatitis Reader 1 | Reader 2  
---|---  
 Present, High Confidence |  Present High or Medium Confidence  
 Present, Medium Confidence |  Present High, Medium, or Low Confidence  
 Present, Low Confidence |  Present Medium or Low Confidence or Absent  
 Absent |  Present Low Confidence or Absent  
 Diagnosis Missing |  Diagnosis Missing  
  
Rule 2:

Sample person (SP) images go to if the two readings for Psoriasis are not on
the list of acceptable combinations (same as above).

Rule 3:

Sample person (SP) images go to consensus for values given for Fitzpatrick
Skin Type in accordance with the following matrix. Value range is 1-6 for each
reader. (Readings for reader 1 on rows and for reader 2 in columns.) Any
outcome that resulted in "reject" went to consensus.

Fitzpatrick Skin Type  Fitzpatrick Values | 1 | 2  | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 | Accept | Accept  | Accept | Reject | Reject  | Reject  
2 | Accept | Accept | Accept | Reject | Reject | Reject  
3 | Accept | Accept | Accept | Reject | Reject | Reject  
4 | Reject | Reject | Reject | Accept | Accept | Accept  
5 | Reject | Reject | Reject | Accept | Accept | Accept  
6 | Reject | Reject | Reject | Accept | Accept | Accept  
  
Rule 4:

If any critical value is missing for either reader the sample person's image
is sent for consensus reading.

Critical values include:

  * Fitzpatrick Skin Type 
  * Hand Dermatitis or Psoriasis Present/Absent 
  * Confidence (if Hand Dermatitis or Psoriasis is present only) 
  * Location (if Hand Dermatitis or Psoriasis is present only) 

In addition, a consensus reading was required for any condition requiring
follow-up.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines on the NHANES website for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
