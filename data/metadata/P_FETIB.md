### Iron Status - Serum (P_FETIB)

####  Data File: P_FETIB.xpt

##### First Published: August 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Specific goals of the serum iron status component include providing data in a
nationally representative sample to: 1) assess overall iron status and
function; 2) assess iron deficiency anemia and anemias of chronic diseases; 3)
monitor trends in measures of nutritional status; and 4) assess and provide
estimates of liver function in support of the liver elastography component.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older, in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample, were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

All methods were measured on the Roche Cobas 6000 (c501 module) analyzer.

**Iron (Frozen)**

The Roche method of iron measurement is a three-step process using the
FerroZine reagent: Fe3+ is liberated from transferrin by acid/detergent, Fe3+
is reduced to Fe2+ by ascorbate, and the reduced iron then reacts with the
FerroZine reagent to form a colored complex. The intensity of this final
product is directly proportional to the iron concentration in the sample.

**Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity (UIBC)**

In the first step of the measurement process in the Roche method for UIBC,
excess Fe2+ is added to the specimen. In an alkaline environment it is
converted to Fe3+ as it binds to the unbound endogenous transferrin. The
unbound Fe2+ in the reagent then reacts with the FerroZine reagent to form a
colored compound. This is an inverse outcome: greater color development
indicates the transferrin is more highly occupied by iron (low UIBC). Lesser
color development indicates that the transferrin has more binding capacity
available (high UIBC). Because of this characteristic and the calibration
model, all results are multiplied by a factor (-1) to yield a positive result.
This is a two-point, endpoint reaction, with measurement occurring at 546 nm
(secondary wavelength 700 nm).

**Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC)**

Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) was calculated indirectly using Iron
(frozen), serum and Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity, serum (UIBC):

**Calculated TIBC (LBDTIB) =** [Iron (frozen), serum (LBXIRN) + UIBC, serum
(LBXUIB)]

**Transferrin Saturation (%Sat)**

Transferrin saturation (%Sat) value was calculated using Iron (frozen), serum
and calculated Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC):

**Calculated %Sat (LBDPCT) =** [Iron (frozen), serum (LBXIRN) / TIBC (LBDTIB)]
x 100

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the University of
Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures
Manuals](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
(LPMs). Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until
they were shipped to the University of Minnesota for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split specimens collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

There were three additional variables created in this data file to convert the
analyzed values into International System of Units (SI). These variables were
created using the following formulas:

**LBDIRNSI**

The iron frozen, serum (LBXIRN) in ug/dL was converted to umol/L (LBDIRNSI) by
multiplying by **0.1791**.

**LBDUIBSI**

The Unsaturated Iron Binding Capacity, serum (LBXUIB) in ug/dL was converted
to umol/L (LBDUIBSI) by multiplying by **0.1791**.****

**LBDTIBSI**

The calculated Total Iron Binding Capacity (LBXTIB) in ug/dL was converted to
umol/L (LBDTIBSI) by multiplying by **0.1791**.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate
for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/ContinuousNhanes/OverviewLab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/ContinuousNhanes/OverviewLab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020, approximately 76%
of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographics File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [NHANES 2017-March 2020 Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

The laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data file using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).
