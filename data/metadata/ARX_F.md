## Component Description

In NHANES 2009-2010, Arthritis Body Measurements were obtained as a part of a
2-year data collection effort to obtain U.S. prevalence estimates for certain
Spondylarthritis (SpA) related conditions. Data collection included a
Household Interview questionnaire on Inflammatory Back Pain and SpA related
conditions (ARQ_F) and also data for the HLA-B27 biomarker (B27_F_R) (Dillon &
Hirsch, 2011). The U.S. nationally representative prevalence of these
disorders had not been previously reported (Helmick et al., 2008).

Spinal arthritis or Spondyloarthritis is a common form of chronic arthritis
among U.S. adults. It can affect the spine at any level including the neck,
the upper back, the mid-back, the low back or the sacroiliac joints.
Spondyloarthritis is often associated with physical impairment due to
decreased spinal mobility and can lead to early mortality.

The Arthritis Body Measures were designed to assess the degree of a
participant's spinal mobility at each of three levels: the neck the mid-back
and the low back. These represent spinal mobility in the cervical spine,
thoracic spine and the lumbo-sacral spine, respectively. Three physical
measures were obtained:

• Occiput-to-Wall Distance (OWD) measurement,  
• Chest Expansion (CE) measurement  
• Active Lumbar Flexion (LF) measurement (also called the modified Schober's
test).

These three arthritis body measures are standard tests in clinical medicine,
but have not been previously used in large scale population based surveys. The
aim of the current NHANES 2009-2010 arthritis body measures data collection is
to establish U.S. population based reference ranges for these clinical
indicators of spinal mobility.



## Eligible Sample

The Arthritis Body Measures were obtained on a full sample of male and female
participants ages 20 to 69 years.

There were no specific medical, safety, or other exclusions for the Arthritis
Body Measurement protocol. Measurements were obtained on all participants who
were able to stand unassisted, even if only for a short period of time (e.g.
those using wheelchairs). Although current back or spinal pain was not a
specific exclusion, the Health Technicians used their discretion to obtain the
Arthritis Body Measures when a participant had current spinal or back pain.



## Protocol and Procedure

Data for the three arthritis body measurements were collected by the same
trained Health Technicians who performed the NHANES anthropometric
examinations: the three measures were included in the 2009-2010 NHANES
anthropometry protocol because of their similarity to the body measures
already being routinely obtained by NHANES. The detailed protocols for
obtaining the three measurements are documented in the [NHANES 2009-2010
Anthropometry Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/bodymeasures_09.pdf)
.

The Occiput to Wall Distance is a routine clinical test for cervical spine
mobility that has been in use for many years. The OWD is measured by having an
examinee stand with the back against a wall keeping the posture as straight as
possible and with the heels, buttocks and shoulders touching the wall. While
looking forward, the examinee also attempts to have the back of the head (the
occiput) touch the wall as well. In most normal individuals in this standard
position, the occiput will touch the wall and the OWD measurement will be
zero. If the occiput does not touch the wall, then the OWD is measured with a
goniometer. A value greater than 2 cm. is considered to be abnormal. The OWD
may be abnormal in kyphosis (forward curvature of the upper thoracic spine)
due to either spondyloarthritis or osteoporosis, as well as in other
conditions such as postural instability, congenital spinal deformity and
marked obesity.

Chest Expansion measurement is a clinical measure to assess limitation of
thoracic spine mobility. It measures the range of motion of joints that
connect the posterior ends of the ribs to the thoracic spine. These small
joints are usually activated only with very deep breathing. In normal
breathing, it is only the muscular diaphragm that varies in position. However
with deep inspiration, the posterior joints between the ribs and the thoracic
spine become active pivoting the rib cage upward resulting in chest
"expansion." This allows additional volume for the lungs to expand in a deep
inspiration. In spondyloarthritis, these small posterior joints between the
ribs and the spine may become affected by arthritis resulting in reduced chest
expansion. Two chest circumference measurements are made: the first at full
exhalation when the lungs are "empty" and a second after a maximal or full
inspiration. The Chest Expansion measurement is taken as the difference in cm
between the measured chest circumference in full inspiration minus the chest
circumference in full exhalation.

The Lumbar Flexion measurement (modified Schober's test) is a clinical measure
to assess lumbosacral spine mobility. It is performed as follows: with the
examinee standing upright, a mark is placed at a point on the skin over the
lower lumbosacral spine and a second mark is placed 10 cm above this to
provide a baseline for measurement. The examinee then bends forward as much as
possible and attempts to touch the toes. The knees are kept straight. With the
examinee still bending forward, the distance between the two marks is again
measured. Normally, the measured distance between the two marked points will
increase due to flexion of the spine when bending forward. A reduction in the
measured distance may reflect a reduction in lumbar spine mobility due to
stiffness in spinal arthritis or other causes.



## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The 2009-2010 NHANES arthritis data was collected as a part of the ongoing
NHANES Body Measures examination, which provides U.S. national-level reference
anthropometry data on height, weight, waist and limb circumferences, and
skinfolds. All NHANES Mobile Examination Center (MEC) health technicians
received professional training in obtaining body measurements, as well as
periodic refresher training. Prior to conducting the 2009-2010 Arthritis body
measures exam, most health technicians had already had 5-10 years of
anthropometry data collection experience in the MEC.  
  
The three NHANES arthritis body measures, like other NHANES anthropometry
data, were obtained by a team of two technicians working together, rather than
by a single technician. One technician performed the measurement and the
second verified that the measurement technique and value were correct and then
recorded the data. In the MEC, the Chief Health Technician directly monitored
staff performance, which included the arthritis body measures/anthropometry
staff. Health technician performance was also monitored during the QC process
for data analysis of all incoming data. This occurred on an ongoing basis, and
during regularly scheduled site visits by NCHS staff and a professional
Anthropometrist directly observing data collection procedures. The NHANES Body
Measures Procedures Manual provides more detailed descriptions of measurement
techniques and the quality assurance and quality control measures used in the
NHANES anthropometry component.

During the 2009-2010 survey, inter-observer reliability statistics for the
three arthritis body measures were assessed on a periodic basis using a Gold
Standard Examiner (GSE). These compared the health technicians' measurements
to the GSE's measurements on the same participants. During each exam, the
health technicians and the GSE separately performed a single measurement on
the participant, so inter-examiner (not intra-examiner) reliability was
measured. If needed, a health technician also received retraining at that time
to help improve technique. Bland Altman plots for Chest Circumference and
Lumbar Flexion measurements are presented in Appendix A. Gold Standard
examination summary statistics for the three arthritis body measures including
correlation coefficients and Technical Error of the Measurements (Norton &
Olds, 2001; WHO Study Group, 2006) are as follows:

For the Occiput-to-Wall distance measurement, 95% of sample measurements were
zero. All the Occiput-to-Wall distance inter-rater measurement pairs were
concordant: i.e. there were no discordant pairs such that if the Occiput-to-
Wall distance for one examiner=0 then the Occiput-to-Wall distance for the
paired examiner was > 0\.

## Data Processing and Editing

The 2009-2010 Arthritis Body Measures data were reviewed for unusual and
erroneous values. Range checks were employed including flagging values for
review that were above the 99th percentile or below the 1st percentile. A very
few values that were determined to be data recording errors were corrected in
this file. None of the other original body measures data were changed and
there are no imputed values in this file.

Derived Variables:  
1\. A final Arthritis Body Measures component status code variable (ARDEXSTS)
provides analysts with a quick method of identifying survey participants with
complete or partial arthritis body measurement data.

2\. For the Chest Expansion measurements, the variable ARDDINEX provides the
difference in cm between the chest circumference measurement in full
inspiration and the chest circumference measurement in full exhalation. This
is the difference value that is typically evaluated by clinicians.

3\. For the Lumbar Flexion measurement, a single derived variable ARDLFTL is
provided. This represents the difference in cm between the lumbar flexion
measurement taken with the examinee bending forward in full lumbar flexion
minus the 10 cm baseline measurement. For the Lumbar Flexion Test, ARDLFTL is
the difference value that is typically evaluated by clinicians.



## Analytic Notes

Each of the three NHANES Arthritis Body Measures were clinical examination
tests that had been in long term use in Medicine, primarily in the field of
arthritis evaluation and treatment. However they had not been previously used
in large scale population based surveys. The intent of the NHANES survey was
to field the three tests in their original clinical forms, however for the
Chest Expansion test this was not practical. In particular, the originally
specified protocol for the Chest Expansion test obtains chest circumference
measurements at the level of the 2nd intercostal space. In clinical settings,
the measurement is primarily obtained in males as opposed to females. Initial
NHANES feasibility tests showed that performing chest circumference
measurements at the level of the 2nd intercostal space was unreliable or in
fact not feasible due to breast tissue for a large percentage of women that
were examined. The population based survey setting required a single chest
circumference measurement protocol that would provide valid comparison data
between genders. A lower level on the chest was needed to obtain valid and
comparable chest circumference measurements in all examinees.

The NHANES 2009-2010 survey obtained chest circumference measurements at the
level of the xiphoid notch. However even at this lower level, chest
circumference measurement was often difficult to obtain, especially among
women. In such instances, the NHANES protocol was to take the chest
circumference measurement at the next lowest level on the chest where a
circumference measurement could be practically obtained. For these instances,
ARXXDIST is the variable that documents the distance between this level and
the level of the xiphoid notch. ARXXDIST was 1 cm or greater for over 20% of
women examined. In the NHANES protocol, all chest circumference measurements
were obtained by a team of two Health Technicians: one Health Technician to
obtain the primary measurement and a second Health Technician to verify that
the measuring tape was positioned correctly and properly aligned horizontal to
the exam room floor and maintained at the same position on the chest as the
particpant went from full exhalation to full inspiration. In NHANES 2009-2010,
a metal measuring tape was used instead of a cloth measuring tape, as is the
more common practice in clincial settings (Bockenhauer 2007).

In clinical medicine, it is considered that the normal chest expansion between
complete exhalation to complete inspiration ranges from 3 to 7 centimeters. A
value less than 2.5 centimeters is often considered abnormal (Weiss et al.,
2010). Reduced chest expansion is often seen in spinal arthritis such as SpA,
but can also be seen in lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD), in chest wall deformities, or with chest wall pain. It can
also be seen in smaller individuals or it can simply be the result of a poor
effort in exhalation or inspiration. Chest Expansion measurements are
therefore effort dependent and measurement validity depends on the
participant's efforts. The NHANES Health Technicians spent considerable time
coaching participants to make maximal inspirations and exhalations. They were
well versed in this because they were also administering Spirometry tests to
this same set of survey participants.

In Spondyloarthritis cases, an abnormality in the Occiput to Wall Distance
test most likely reflects a more advanced stage of disease. For example, the
OWD is correlated with positive spinal radiographic findings in the neck in
Ankylosing Spondylitis, which is the prototype disorder for SpA. The OWD test
also has relatively high interobserver reliability (Viitanen, et al. 1995,
2000). In the NHANES 2009-2010 data collection, the great majority of
examinees had a normal OWD (i.e they were able to touch the back of their head
to the measurement stadiometer when standing straight) and only about 5% of
examinees had an OWD measurerment greater than zero. NHANES 2009-2010 did not
specifically examine participants for kyphosis (forward curvature of the upper
spine), however in the general NHANES Body Measures data collection (BMX_F),
the variable BMIHT is available which has a code indicating that the
examinee's spine was not straight (i.e the examinee had either kyphosis or
scoliosis). This variable can be used to help interpret the OWD test results.

The Lumbar Flexion measurement obtained in NHANES 2009-2010 is similar to
standard clinical protocols. There is variation among different published
studies as to where best to place the lower boundary mark for the baseline LF
test measurement and whether the baseline measurement distance should be 10 or
15 cm. In the original description of the LF test, a 10 cm. distance upward
beginning from the lumbosacral junction was specified (Schober, 1937).
Subsequently a 15 cm baseline distance was specified measured from 5 cm below
to 10 cm above the lumbosacral junction (Macrae and Wright, 1969; Moll and
Wright, 1972). This is the approximate level of the superior margins of the
sacroiliac joints in the pelvis. More recently a 15 cm baseline measurement
was specified that begins with marking a point midway along a line level with
the iliac crests (a line thought to mark the the L4/5 junction), then marking
points 5 cm below and 10 cm above this (Gladman et al. 2007; Jenkinson et al.
1994). Other research indicates this line is at the level of the L4 spinous
process or the L4-5 interspinous spaces (Chakraverty et al., 2007).

The NHANES LF was performed similarly to the above LF tests except that the
initial point for the baseline LF distance was marked midway along a line
level with the superior margin of the lateral iliac crests and a then second
mark was placed 10 cm above it. The superior margin of the lateral iliac
crests is the same landmark used in the NHANES Anthropometry exam to measure
waist circumference. This landmark was selected for reliability as it is
easily palpable, because the Health Technicians already had considerable
experience locating it, and because of participant privacy concerns of using a
lower landmark in the population based survey. The measuring tape was always
maintained directly against the skin when measuring and marking the 10 cm
baseline LF distance. For example in examinees with marked lumbar lordosis,
the 10 cm measurement followed the course of the inward curve of the lordosis.
The one exception to this was in markedly overweight examinees who had large
fat folds.

Sample Weights: The NHANES examination sample weights should be used to
analyze the arthritis body measurement data. Please refer to the [NHANES
Analytic Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)
and the on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
