### Insulin (INS_H)

####  Data File: INS_H.xpt

##### First Published: April 2016

##### Last Revised: NA

##### Note: See Analytical Notes

## Component Description

Insulin is the primary hormone responsible for controlling glucose metabolism,
and its secretion is determined by plasma glucose concentration. The insulin
molecule is synthesized in the pancreas as pro-insulin and is later cleaved to
form C-peptide and insulin. The principal function of insulin is to control
the uptake and utilization of glucose in the peripheral tissues. Insulin
concentrations are severely reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(IDDM) and some other conditions, while insulin concentrations are raised in
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), obesity, and some endocrine
disorders.

Diabetes is a leading cause of disease and death in the United States.
Approximately eight million Americans are known to have diabetes, and it is
estimated that an equal amount have undiagnosed diabetes. In 1993, nearly 18
percent of all deaths for persons over the age of 25 were among people with
diabetes. The prevalence of diabetes and overweight (one of the major risk
factors for diabetes) continues to increase. Substantial new efforts to
prevent or control diabetes have begun, including the Diabetes Prevention
Trial and the National Diabetes Education Program.

Diabetes testing provides population data to: 1) determine a national estimate
of diabetes disease prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed); 2) identify the
risk factors of diabetes disease; 3) permit a national cohort to be
established for follow-up studies of this condition; and 4) provide critical
information to clinicians and public health officials for the development of
preventive care and community-based interventions.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and older who were examined in the morning session
were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The AIA-PACK IRI is a two-site immunoenzymometric assay, which is performed on
Tosoh AIA System analyzer. This assay is designed for the quantitative
measurement of Insulin (IRI) in human serum. Insulin present in the test
sample is bound with monoclonal antibody immobilized on a magnetic solid phase
and enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody in the AIA-PACK. The magnetic beads are
washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody and are then
incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP).
The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to the beads is
directly proportional to the insulin concentration in the test sample. A
standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are
calculated using this curve.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were changes to the lab method, lab equipment and lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle. In the 2011-2012 cycle, the
University of Minnesota performed this testing. The University of Missouri-
Columbia began testing insulin in the 2013-2014 cycle.

(April 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the University of
Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the University of Missouriâs quality control and
quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to
the Westgard rules

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

One variable was created in this data file using the following formula:

**LBXIN and LBDINSI:**  
The insulin value in ÂµU/mL (LBXIN) was converted to pmol/L (LBDINSI) by
multiplying by 6.0 (rounded to 2 decimals).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2013-2014 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Sampling Weights**

Insulin was measured in a fasting subsample of persons 12 years and older.

The analyst is strongly encouraged to use the fasting sampling weights in this
file to analyze 2013-2014 insulin levels.

There will be two weight files associated with the subsample for the diabetes
data. Use the fasting sample weights (WTSFA2YR) when analyzing the fasting
glucose and insulin levels only. Use the OGTT sample weights (WTSOG2YR) when
analyzing the insulin, fasting AND OGTT glucose levels or when analyzing ONLY
OGTT glucose levels. NOTE: plasma fasting glucose and OGTT weights and data
are in separate files (GLU_H and OGTT_H, respectively).

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

The Fasting Questionnaire File includes auxiliary information such as fasting
status, the time of venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture.

The demographics and fasting questionnaire files may be linked to the
laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier (i.e.,
SEQN).

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

** ** The detection limits were constant for the analyte in the data set. The
variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXIN) provides the analytic result for that
analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in uU/mL) for insulin is:

 **Variable Name** | **  SAS Label** | **LLOD  **  
---|---|---  
 LBXIN |  Insulin |  1.0  
  
***Analytic Note for Change in Serum Insulin Methods from 2011-2012 cycle to
2013-2014 cycle**

**Change in methods for serum insulin methods**

There was a change in serum insulin methods from 2011-2012 to 2013-2014. In
2011-2012, serum insulin was performed using a chemiluminescent âsandwichâ
immunoassay performed on the Roche Elecsys 2010 analyzer. In 2013-2014, serum
insulin was performed using a two-site immunoenzymometric assay performed on
the Tosoh AIA-900 analyzer. The geometric mean (SE) insulin of participants
decreased from 10.31 (0.17) ÂµU/mL in 2011-2012 to 9.20 (0.27) ÂµU/mL  in
2013-2014. A crossover study was performed on 237 specimens performed by the
Roche and Tosoh insulin methods. The Roche insulin method arithmetic mean was
11.3% higher than the Tosoh method mean (16.01 vs. 14.39 ÂµU/mL, respectively)
for the crossover study. To trend the serum insulin from 2011-2014, the
insulin values were log10 transformed since the distribution of values were
skewed. The following âbackwardâ Deming regression can be applied to trend
the 2013-2014 Tosoh method values to match the 2011-2012 Roche method values
(ÂµU/mL):

Insulin (Roche-equivalent) = 10**(0.9765*log10(Tosoh insulin) + 0.07832)

Alternatively, the following âforwardâ Deming regression can be applied to
trend the 2011-2012 Roche method values to match the 2013-2014 Tosoh method
values (ÂµU/mL):

Insulin (Tosoh-equivalent) = 10**(1.024*log10(Roche insulin) â 0.0802)

The application of the âbackwardâ Deming regression to the participant
insulin distribution of 2011-2014 can be seen in the following table:

Weighted geometric mean, standard error of the geometric mean and selected percentiles for serum insulin (ÂµU/mL) Years | N | Geometic Mean | SE Geometic Mean | 5th percentile | 25th percentile | 50th percentile | 75th percentile | 95th percentile  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2011-2012 | 2704 | 10.31 | 0.17 | 3.51 | 6.47 | 10.13 | 16.21 | 32.22  
Unadjusted 2013-2014 | 2848 | 9.20 | 0.27 | 3.00 | 5.74 | 8.89 | 14.38 | 31.57  
Deming-adjusted 2013-2014 | 2848 | 10.46 | 0.31 | 3.50 | 6.60 | 10.12 | 16.17 | 34.86  
  
Serum insulin is not currently standardized or harmonized so methods can
differ and adjustments are recommended to trend insulin values.

Please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines and the on-line NHANES Tutorial
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
