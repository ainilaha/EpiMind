### Food Frequency Questionnaire - Raw Questionnaire Responses (FFQRAW_C)

####  Data File: FFQRAW_C.xpt

#####  First Published: February 2008

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) (previously referred to as the NHANES
Food Propensity Questionnaire or "FPQ"), was added to NHANES 2003-2004. The
FFQ was used to collect information on the frequency of food consumption
during the past 12 months. Two FFQ public data release files were produced.
The FFQ Questionnaire File (SAS name: FFQRAW_C) provides information on the
actual or "raw" questionnaire data. The other FFQ file (SAS name: FFQDC_C),
contains daily frequency covariates on food intake. The FFQ data augment the
other NHANES 2003-2004 dietary assessment components which include two 24-hour
dietary recall interviews and interview information on dietary supplement use,
food security, and dietary behavior.

**Frequency Questions in NHANES 1999-2002**

A few food frequency questions were included in NHANES 1999-2002 to determine
the frequency of consumption of milk, fish and shellfish, legumes, and leafy
green vegetables. The FFQ questionnaire is a more comprehensive instrument and
the data may be used to estimate the usual intake of foods.

**FFQ Development And Validation**

The NHANES FFQ questionnaire was developed by the National Institutes of
Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI). The NCI Diet History Questionnaire
(DHQ), a 124-item food frequency instrument that is widely used in nutritional
epidemiology research (Subar 2001a) is the basis for the NHANES FFQ.

NCI completed extensive research to develop the DHQ food list, test the
usability of the questionnaire form, and demonstrate the validity of data
produced using the DHQ. The DHQ food list was compiled using food consumption
information collected during the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1994-96
Continuing Survey of Food Intake by Individuals (CSFII). Cognitive testing
research was conducted to pretest the DHQ format, wording of questions, and
presentation (Subar 1995, Thompson 2002). NCI researchers validated the DHQ
and compared results obtained with the DHQ to other food frequency instruments
(Subar 2001a, Subar 2001b). The FFQ differs from the DHQ in several respects.
The research used to develop the FFQ is described by Subar et al. (2006).

Unlike the DHQ, portion size information is not collected with the FFQ,
because the FFQ was not intended to be used to derive estimates of absolute
intake for either nutrients or foods (Subar 2006). The original DHQ food item
list was modified slightly during the development of the FFQ.

Questions on the proportion of the time oatmeal was consumed as a hot cereal,
and the proportion of time cooked grains consumed were whole grains were added
to the original DHQ. Several DHQ questions pertaining to added fats and oils
were excluded from the FFQ because discretionary fats are consumed frequently
and usual intake of these items can be estimated using statistical methods
applied to 24-hr dietary recall data. Additionally, frequency of use for added
fats, spreads, and oils is difficult for respondents to estimate.

The DHQ was originally developed based on CSFII data for adults. NCI analyzed
1994-96 and 1998 CSFII data for children and used the results from the
analysis to develop new questions on apple juice, grape juice, granola bar,
and pudding/custard consumption frequency for the FFQ. NCI retained most of
the standard DHQ items in the FFQ, even if each was not linked to a Dietary
Guideline or dietary goal. NCI researchers assessed the fitness of the FFQ for
its intended purpose--that is, as supplemental information regarding frequency
of food consumption (Subar et al, 2006)--and found it to be suitable for that
purpose.

The NHANES FFQ contains several types of questions. There are 151 frequency
questions (this includes two frequency sub-questions querying intake over two
seasons for questions 9, 10, 13, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 35, 42, 43, 97). The FFQ
also asks about the proportion (reported as fractions) of the time certain
types of foods were eaten over the past 12 months such as sugar-free soft
drinks, whole grain foods, and light, low-fat or fat-free varieties of foods.

## Eligible Sample

All English or Spanish-speaking examinees 2+ years of age who completed at
least one 24-hr dietary recall interview (Dietary Interview component variable
DRTINT values of 1 or 2) were eligible for the FFQ component. There were 6,472
respondents in this group with FFQ data. English and Spanish language versions
of the FFQ were used to collect the data and the English version of the FFQ is
available on the NHANES 2003-2004 website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Quality control programs and manual verification checks were used to verify
the completeness and accuracy of the data. All scanned FFQ records are
included in the questionnaire file (FFQRAW_C). A questionnaire completion
variable (variable name: FFQ_MISS) lists the number of unanswered, but
applicable FFQ questions (range: zero to 151). Only missing frequency
questions were counted. Two frequency values were possible for the seasonal
consumption questions (9, 10, 13, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 35, 42, 43, and 97). The
following algorithm was used to assign missing values:

Number of Frequencies Counted as Missing Depending on Answer to Lead-in Question Embedded questions (i.e. Q9a and Q9b) | No | Yes | Missing  
---|---|---|---  
a and b missing | 0 | 2 | 2  
a and b not missing | 0 | 0 | 0  
a or b missing | 1 | 1 | 1  
  
Missing responses for other types of embedded questions in the FFQ were not
included in the FFQ_MISS variable count. Diet*Calc, the software which was
used to calculate daily food frequencies, imputed values when the non-
frequency questions were not answered (see documentation in file FFQDC_C).
Analysts should evaluate the completeness of the data prior to using the FFQ
data in their analyses.

## Data Processing and Editing

None of the completed FFQ questionnaire data were edited. The scanned results
are reported in this file. Review the Analytic Notes and the file Codebook
before analyzing the data.

## Analytic Notes

Review the NHANES Analytic Guidelines carefully.

Special FFQ sample weights were produced for the FFQ subsample. Analysts
should use the FFQ sample weight (variable name: WTS_FFQ) for all FFQ data
analyses. The FFQ sample weights were derived from the NHANES 2003-2004
examined sample weights and were designed to account for FFQ non-response.
Respondents with fewer than ten missing frequency values (i.e. FFQ_MISS < 10)
have an FFQ sample weight.

Unique Codes: This file contains special codes for unanswered questions (code
88 for "Blank" responses) and erroneous responses resulting from scanning
errors (code 99 "Error").

Discrepant responses: The FFQ questionnaire results were not edited. There are
inconsistent results for some of the lead-in and follow-up questions. For
example, respondents sometimes reported that they never ate certain foods, but
provided answers to the follow-up questions. The DietCalc software applied
programming rules to process the raw questionnaire data to produce the daily
frequency covariates in the FFQDC_C file.
