### Lead - Dust (L20_B)

####  Data File: L20_B.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2006

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Lead is a known environmental toxin that has been shown to deleteriously
affect the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and reproductive systems.
In young children, lead exposure is a particular hazard because children more
readily absorb lead than do adults, and children's developing nervous systems
also make them more susceptible to the effects of lead. Since first measuring
blood lead during the 1976-1980 survey, NHANES has been the cornerstone for
lead exposure surveillance in the U.S.

In 1999, NHANES began to collect dust samples from the homes of children 1-5
years of age to be tested for the presence of lead. Lead in dust is most often
the result of old, peeling, or chipping lead-based paint. As part of the
household visit, NHANES interviewers collected separate dust-wipe samples from
the floor and window sill of one room in the home. Signing of a special
informed consent was required prior to the collection.

## Eligible Sample

Eligible survey participants were households with children 1-5 years of age.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The preparation procedure for dust-wipe sample digestion involves the
quantitative transfer of the sample from the container into a beaker, and then
the subsequent addition of nitric and hydrochloric acids and hot-plate
heating. The procedure is described in the Appendix of the Guidelines for the
Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing (1). The
technique does not involve complete digestion of the sample, but does entail
leaching of the lead (Pb) from the collected dust. Recovery of the method is
based and evaluated on the results of matrix (wipe) spiked National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) quality control samples. The lead content
of the digestate is determined by using a PerkinElmer Flame Atomic Absorption
Spectrometer (FAAS) Model 5000 or 5100 for all window dust-wipe samples and a
PerkinElmer Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (GFAAS) Model 5100
for all floor dust-wipe samples. However, a floor dust sample whose value was
found to be 5 μg or greater by GFAAS are re-analyzed by FAAS and that value is
reported.

## Data Processing and Editing

Detailed specimen collection instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Household Interview Procedures Manual, Chapter 7. This chapter specifies the
procedure to be used for preparation of the window and floor, specimen
collection, labeling, and conditions for specimen transport.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Additional dust samples (either window sill or floor) were taken in 5% of
households as part of the quality control procedures. A field blank was also
collected. Results from these quality control measures are not included as
part of this data file.

For years 2001-2002, the floor samples (n=60) had a 96.9% (+/-4.9%) recovery
at an average spike level of 72.88 (sd 15.69) μg. The window sill samples
(n=59) revealed a 96.9% (+/-4.3%) recovery at an average spike level of 70.58
(sd 15.34) μg.

## Analytic Notes

This data file includes the laboratory values as well as variables related to
characteristics of the room where the samples were taken, and other factors
relevant to data collection.

**DCDINDEX**

The variable identifies the index child designated for dust collection.
Descriptive data about the home environment and the dust samples were
collected for one child in the household. In homes where more than one child
aged 1-5 years resided, the descriptive and laboratory data for the index
child were assigned to all other children in the age group.

**DCDSTAT**

This variable indicates which samples are available. In some households, only
a single sample (either window sill or floor) was taken. This variable was
derived based on final results from the laboratory.

**DCD030**

The room where the sample was taken was most often the same room where the
child spent most of his or her time in the home. In editing this variable,
some responses from the "other" category were re-coded to pre-existing
categories, and additional categories were created.

**DCD070A**

Carpet in room selected for sample. Response categories ordering from the
original question were reordered for purposes of clarification and
consistency.

It is advised that this data file should be combined with additional years of
data because data are available on a small subset of the survey population.
This data file was designed to be used primarily at the SP level with other
data collected in the MEC. Please note, data were retained for persons who
took part in the household interview (including dust collection) but were not
examined at the MEC.

**LBXDFS**

Floor sample, lead dust result (μg/sq ft), by GFAAS. All floor dust results
are derived from a 1 square foot area, the size of the template used for the
sample collection. If a floor sample was collected but the result is missing
for LBXDFS, use LBXDFSF. Use LBDDFSLC, the laboratory comment code, to
determine values below the limit of detection.

**LBXDFSF**

Floor sample, lead dust result (μg/sq ft) by FAAS. All floor dust results are
derived from a 1 square foot area, the size of the template used for the
sample collection. If a floor sample was collected but the result is missing
for LBXDFSF, use LBXDFS. Use LBDD3LC, the laboratory comment code, to
determine values below the limit of detection.

**LBXDDWS**

Window sill sample, lead dust result (μg/sq ft). All window sill dust results
were calculated based on the measured length and width of the window sill
area. Use LBDDWSLC, the laboratory comment code, to determine values below the
limit of detection.
