### Trans Fatty Acids (TFA_A)

####  Data File: TFA_A.xpt

##### First Published: May 2016

##### Last Revised: March 2019

## Component Description

Trans fatty acids are unsaturated fatty acids that contain at least one double
bond in the trans configuration. The three-dimensional structure of trans
fatty acids is more similar to saturated fatty acids than to regular
unsaturated fatty acids, which have their double bond in the cis
configuration. The trans configuration substantially alters the physical
properties of the fatty acids, and thus the properties of the oil containing
these trans fatty acids for cooking and food manufacturing. Also, it
substantially alters the biologic and health effects of the fatty acids when
consumed.

A positive relationship between trans fatty acid intake, and total and LDL
cholesterol concentration was established, which links elevated trans fatty
acids in blood with increased risk of coronary heart diseases. The Institute
of Medicine recommended that 'trans fatty acid consumption be as low as
possible while consuming a nutritionally adequate diet'.

In addition, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2000 and guidelines from
the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), were similar with
recommendations to limit trans fat intake in the diet. In 2003, FDA amended
its regulations on nutrition labeling to require that trans fatty acids be
declared in the nutrition label of conventional foods and dietary supplements.
This rule is intended to provide information to assist consumers in
maintaining healthy dietary practices. In 2015, FDA determined that partially
hydrogenated oils, the major source of artificial trans fat in the food
supply, are no longer "Generally Recognized as Safe," or GRAS. This new rule
will be fully in effect in 2020.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The laboratory method used in this study was described previously (Kuiper et
al. 2018) and measures the total (free and esterified) content of selected
trans fatty acids in plasma and provides results in concentration. The trans
fatty acids measured with this method are: trans-9-hexadecenoic acid
(palmitelaidic acid, C16:1n-7t), trans-9-octadecenoic acid (elaidic acid,
C18:1n-9t), trans-11-octadecenoic acid (vaccenic acid, C18:1n-7t), trans-9,
trans-12-octadecadienoic acid (linolelaidic acid, C18:2n-6t, 9t).

The fatty acids in plasma are converted into free fatty acids by subsequent
acidic and alkaline hydrolysis. The free fatty acids are extracted from the
sample solution using liquid-liquid extraction and derivatized with
pentafluorobenzylbromide (PFB-Br). The derivatized fatty acids are separated
by capillary gas chromatography and detected by mass spectrometry using
negative chemical ionization.

The fatty acids are identified based on their chromatographic retention time
and on the specific mass to charge ratio of the ion formed in the ion source.
Retention times are compared against those obtained with known standards.
Quantitation is performed with standard solution using stable isotope-labeled
fatty acids as internal standards.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

Trans fatty acids is a new component in the 1999-2000 survey cycle.

(Updated February 2019)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Plasma specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Divisions of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=1999).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=1999).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories  
**NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [1999-2000 Laboratory Data Overview
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=1999)for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial ](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)for details on
the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Sample weights**

**** Trans fatty acids were measured in a full sample of participants 6-11
years old and a fasting subsample of persons 12 years and over.

**Demographics and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 1999-2000
Demographics](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=1999)
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Questionnaire&CycleBeginYear=1999)
includes auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and
the time of venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDHDTLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDHDTLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., LBXHDT)
provides the analytic result for that analyte.

All results were at or above the lower detection limit. The lower limits of
detection (LLOD, in µmol/L) for trans fatty acids are:

**Variable Name  ** |  **SAS Label  ** |  **LLOD  **  
---|---|---  
 LBXHDT |   trans-9-hexadecenoic acid (µmol/L) |   0.07  
 LBXOD9 |   trans-9-octadecenoic acid(µmol/L) |   0.28  
 LBXOD1 |   trans-11-octadecenoic acid(µmol/L) |   0.43  
 LBXOTT |   trans-9,12-octadecadienoicacid(µmol/L) |   0.02
