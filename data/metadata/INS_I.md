### Insulin (INS_I)

####  Data File: INS_I.xpt

##### First Published: June 2018

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Insulin is the primary hormone responsible for controlling glucose metabolism,
and its secretion is determined by plasma glucose concentration. The insulin
molecule is synthesized in the pancreas as pro-insulin and is later cleaved to
form C-peptide and insulin. The principal function of insulin is to control
the uptake and utilization of glucose in the peripheral tissues. Insulin
concentrations are severely reduced in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus
(IDDM) and some other conditions, while insulin concentrations are raised in
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), obesity, and some endocrine
disorders.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and older, who were examined in the morning
session, were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The AIA-PACK IRI is a two-site immunoenzymometric assay, which is performed on
Tosoh AIA System analyzer. This assay is designed for the quantitative
measurement of Insulin (IRI) in human serum. Insulin present in the test
sample is bound with monoclonal antibody immobilized on a magnetic solid phase
and enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody in the AIA-PACK. The magnetic beads are
washed to remove unbound enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody and are then
incubated with a fluorogenic substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (4MUP).
The amount of enzyme-labeled monoclonal antibody that binds to the beads is
directly proportional to the insulin concentration in the test sample. A
standard curve is constructed, and unknown sample concentrations are
calculated using this curve.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the University of
Missouri-Columbia, Columbia, MO for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30oC) conditions until they are
shipped to the University of Missouri â Columbia for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

One variable was created in this data file using the following formula:

**LBXIN and LBDINSI:**  
The insulin value in ÂµU/mL (LBXIN) was converted to pmol/L (LBDINSI) by
multiplying by 6.0 (rounded to 2 decimals).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2015-2016 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Insulin were measured in a fasting subsample of persons 12 years and older.
Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.  Specific
sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be
used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2015-2016/fastqx_i.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the length of fast, and the time
of venipuncture

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending âLCâ (ex., LBDINLC _)_ indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above
the limit of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection.  For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDINLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXIN
_)_ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in uU/mL) for insulin is:

 **Variable Name** |  **  SAS Label** |  **LLOD  **

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
