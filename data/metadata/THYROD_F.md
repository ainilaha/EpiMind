### Thyroid Profile (THYROD_F)

####  Data File: THYROD_F.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2011

#####  Last Revised: October 2015

## Component Description

The Thyroid Profile consists of a battery of several tests for the measurement
of thyroid function, including Total and Free Thyroxine, Total and Free
Triiodothyronine, Thyroglobulin, Thyroglobulin Antibodies, Thyroid Peroxidase
Antibodies, and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone. Thyroid function is crucial for
maintaining normal metabolic function in adults and for proper neurological
development of the fetus. Serum levels will be used to assess thyroid function
and will provide population-based reference information on these hormone
levels.

## Eligible Sample

A one-third sample of participants aged 12 years and older, who do not meet
any of the exclusion criteria, are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Thyroid blood specimens were processed, stored and shipped to University of
Washington, Seattle, WA. Detailed specimen collection and processing
instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists
Procedures Manual (LPM).

**Thyroid-stimulating hormone**

The Access HYPERsensitive human thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH) assay is a
3rd generation, two-site immunoenzymatic (âsandwichâ) assay. A sample is
added to a reaction vessel with goat anti-hTSH-alkaline phosphatase conjugate,
buffered protein solution, and paramagnetic particles coated with immobilized
mouse monoclonal anti-hTSH antibody. (Goat anti-mouse antibody is used to
immobilize the mouse anti-hTSH antibody.) The hTSH binds to the immobilized
monoclonal anti-hTSH on the solid phase while the goat anti-hTSH-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate reacts with a different antigenic site on the hTSH.
After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are
held in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phosâ¢ 530 is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production
is directly proportional to the concentration of human thyroid-stimulating
hormone in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from
a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

Human TSH is one of several glycoprotein hormones consisting of two non-
covalently bound peptide chains: an a-chain, which is nearly identical in all,
and a Ã-chain, which is responsible for immunological and biological
specificity. These similarities result in varying degrees of cross-reactivity
of different antisera. The Access HYPERsensitive hTSH assay has virtually no
cross-reactivity with other peptide hormones. The sensitivity and specificity
of this test enable better discrimination between hyperthyroid and euthyroid
patients.

**Total T3 assay**

The Access Total T3 assay is a competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay.
Sample is added to a reaction vessel with a stripping agent to dissociate T3
from the binding proteins. T3 in the sample competes with the T3 analogue
coupled to biotin for anti-T3 alkaline phosphatase conjugate. Of the resulting
antigen/antibody complexes, the T3 analogue/antibody complexes are bound to
the streptavidin coated solid phase. Separation in a magnetic field and
washing removes the sample T3/antibody complexes and other materials not bound
to the solid phase. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phosâ¢ 530 is
added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a
luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the
concentration of total T3 in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample
is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

**Free T3 assay**

Access Free T3 assay is a competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay. A sample
is added to a reaction vessel with an anti-T3 monoclonal antibody conjugated
to alkaline phosphatase. During the incubation, free T3 in the sample reacts
with the anti-T3 antibody. Particles coated with streptavidin and biotinylated
T3 analog are then added to the mixture. Unoccupied binding sites on the
anti-T3 antibody are bridged to the particle through the T3 analog. After
incubation in a reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held
in a magnetic field while unbound materials are washed away. Then, the
chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phosâ¢ 530 is added to the vessel and light
generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production
is inversely proportional to the concentration of free T3 in the sample. The
amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored, multi-point
calibration curve.

**Total T4 assay**

The Access Total T4 assay is a competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay. A
sample is added to a reaction vessel with anti-thyroxine antibody, thyroxine-
alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coated with goat
anti-mouse capture antibody and a stripping agent to dissociate all T4 from
binding proteins. Thyroxine in the sample competes with the thyroxine-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate for binding sites on a limited amount of specific anti-
thyroxine antibody. Resulting antigen: antibody complexes bind to the capture
antibody on the solid phase. After incubation in a reaction vessel, materials
bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound materials
are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phosâ¢ 530 is
added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a
luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the
concentration of thyroxine in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample
is determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

**Free T4 assay**

The Access Free T4 (FRT4) assay is a two-step enzyme immunoassay. Monoclonal
anti-Thyroxine (T4) antibody coupled to biotin, sample, buffered protein
solution, and streptavidin-coated solid phase are added to the reaction
vessel. During this first incubation, the anti-T4 antibody coupled to biotin
binds to the solid phase and the free T4 in the sample. After incubation in a
reaction vessel, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic
field while unbound materials are washed away. Next, buffered protein solution
and triiodothyronine (T3)-alkaline phosphatase conjugate are added to the
reaction vessel. The T3-alkaline phosphatase conjugate binds to the vacant
anti-T4 antibody binding sites. After incubation in a reaction vessel,
materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. Then, the chemiluminescent substrate Lumi-Phosâ¢
530 is added to the vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is inversely proportional to the
concentration of free T4 in the sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is
determined from a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

**Thyroglobulin (Tg) assay**

The Access thyroglobulin (Tg) assay is a simultaneous one-step "sandwich"
assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel, along with biotinylated mixture
of four monoclonal anti-Tg antibodies, streptavidin coated paramagnetic
particles, and monoclonal anti-Tg antibody alkaline phosphatase conjugate. The
biotinylated antibodies and the serum or plasma thyroglobulin bind to the
solid phase, while the conjugate antibody reacts with a different antigenic
site on the thyroglobulin molecule. After incubation in a reaction vessel,
materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. A chemiluminescent substrate, Lumi-Phos** 530 is
added to the reaction vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured
with a luminometer. The light production is directly proportional to the
concentration of thyroglobulin in the sample. The amount of Thyroglobulin in
the sample is determined by means of a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

**Thyroglobulin antibody assay (TgAb)**

The Access thyroglobulin antibody assay is a sequential two-step
immunoenzymatic "sandwich" assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with
paramagnetic particles coated with the thyroglobulin protein. After
incubation, materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field
while unbound materials are washed away. The thyroglobulin-alkaline
phosphatase conjugate is added and binds to the TgAb. After a second
incubation, the reaction vessel is washed to remove unbound materials. A
chemiluminescent substrate, Lumi-Phosâ¢ 530 is added to the reaction vessel
and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light
production is proportional to the concentration of Thyroglobulin antibody in
the sample. The amount of Thyroglobulin antibody in the sample is determined
by means of a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

**Thyroid peroxidase antibody**

The Access TPO antibody (TPOAb) assay is a sequential two-step immunoenzymatic
"sandwich" assay. A sample is added to a reaction vessel with paramagnetic
particles coated with the thyroid peroxidase protein. After an incubation,
materials bound to the solid phase are held in a magnetic field while unbound
materials are washed away. The protein A-alkaline phosphatase conjugate is
added and binds to the TPOAb. After a second incubation, the reaction vessel
is washed to remove unbound materials. A chemiluminescent substrate, Lumi-
Phosâ¢ 530 is added to the reaction vessel and light generated by the
reaction is measured with a luminometer. The light production is proportional
to the concentration of TPO antibody in the sample. The amount of TPOAb in the
sample is determined by means of a stored, multi-point calibration curve.

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
file for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical
methods are described in the **Description of the Laboratory Methodology**
section.

Five variables in this data file were created. The formula for their creation
is as follows:

Free thyroxine results (LBXT4F) in ng/dL were multiplied by 12.9 into pmol/L
(LBDT4FSI).

Thyroglobin results LBXTGN) in ng/mL were multiplied by 1.0 into µg/L
(LBDTGNSI).

Thyroid stimulating hormone results (LBXTSH1) in µIU/mL were multiplied by 1.0
into mIU/L (LBDTSH1S).

Total triiodothyronine results (LBXTT3) in ng/dL were multiplied by .0154 into
nmol/L (LBDTT3SI).

Total triiodothyronine results (LBXTT3) in ng/dL were multiplied by .0154 into
nmol/L (LBDTT3SI).

The variable named LBD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection. There are two values: "0" and "1"". "0" means that the result
was at or above the limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was
below the limit of detection

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM. Read the
_General Documentation on Laboratory Data_ file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

Analytic Note for 2009-2010 Total Thyroxine:

In 2009-2010, there was a change in laboratories performing the total
thyroxine (TT4). The TT4 was performed at the University of Washington Medical
Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine in 2009 and the TT4 was performed at
the Collaborative Laboratory Services (CLS) in 2010. Both laboratories used a
competitive binding immunoenzymatic assay on the Beckman Coulter Access 2
analyzer. A crossover study of 113 specimens was performed between the two
laboratories and the CLS laboratory values had a higher mean and median
compared to the University of Washington by approximately 5%. This was also
seen in the sample participants when comparing 2009 and 2010 TT4
distributions. The difference in TT4 results may have been due to different
lots of calibrators and reagents. Using a fractional polynomial regression,
the 2010 TT4 participant results were lowered to compare to the 2009 TT4
results.

NHANES survey analysis:

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The Demographic file contains: Status
Variables providing core information on the survey participant including
examination status, Recoded Demographic Variables including age, gender, race
etc., and Interview and Examination Sample Weight Variables and Survey Design
Variables. The Questionnaire Data Files contain socio-economic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on
duration of fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The Demographic, Questionnaire and Phlebotomy
Examination files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
