### Cardiovascular Health (CDQ_J)

####  Data File: CDQ_J.xpt

##### First Published: February 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Cardiovascular Disease and Health section (variable name prefix CDQ)
provides participant-level interview data on evaluating cardiovascular health
and includes questions to assess the presence of angina pectoris as defined by
the Rose questionnaire.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 40 years and older were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system.  

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic
usefulness of the data.

## Analytic Notes

Rose questionnaire criteria1:

**Grade 1 Angina** is defined as CDQ001 = 1 and CDQ002 = 1 (but CDQ003 â‰  1)
and CDQ004 = 1 and CDQ005 = 1 and CDQ006 = 1, plus either (CDQ009D = 4 or
CDQ009E = 5) or (CDQ009F = 6 and CDQ009G = 7).

**Grade 2 Angina** is defined as CDQ001 = 1 and CDQ002 = 1 and CDQ003 = 1 and
CDQ004 = 1 and CDQ005 = 1 and CDQ006 = 1, plus either (CDQ009D = 4 or CDQ009E
= 5) or (CDQ009F = 6 and CDQ009G = 7).
