### Pesticides - Organochlorine Metabolites - Serum (Surplus) (L28OCP_C)

####  Data File: L28OCP_C.xpt

#####  First Published: April 2008

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Organochlorine pesticides, an older class of pesticides, are effective against
a variety of insects. These chemicals were introduced in the 1940s, and many
of their uses have been cancelled or restricted by the U.S. EPA because of
their environmental persistence and potential adverse effects on wildlife and
human health. Many organochlorines are no longer used widely in the U.S., but
other countries continue to use them. Hexachlorobenzene has been used
primarily as a fungicide or biocide.

Organochlorine pesticides are generally persistent in the environment and tend
to bioaccumulate. Because these chemicals are fat soluble, they are found at
higher concentrations in fatty foods. In the general population, diet is the
main source of exposure, primarily through the ingestion of fatty foods such
as dairy products and fish.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Thirty-eight ortho-substituted polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 13 persistent
chlorinated pesticides, and selected pesticide metabolites are measured in
serum by high-resolution gas chromatography/isotope-dilution high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRGC/ID-HRMS). All serum specimens are handled using
Universal Precautions.

Serum specimens (1-1.5 mL) to be analyzed for PCBs and persistent pesticides
are spiked with 13C12-labeled internal standards and the analytes of interest
are isolated in hexane using a C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) procedure
followed by extraction through neutral silica and Florosil SPE columns. PCBs
and pesticides are eluted from the Florosil column with hexane and 1:1
dichloromethane /hexane. For PCBs and pesticides, each analytical run consists
of nine unknown specimens, one method blank, and two quality control samples.
Before quantification, the vials are reconstituted with 10μL 13C-labeled
external standard. Sample extracts are then analyzed simultaneously for PCBs
and pesticides by HRGC/ID-HRMS where 1 μL is injected, using a GC Pal (Leap
Technology) auto sampler, into a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph
operated in the splitless injection mode with a flow of 1 mL/min helium
through a DB-5ms capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 μm film thickness)
where analytes are separated prior to entering a Thermo Finnigan MAT95 XP (5
kV) magnetic sector mass spectrometer operated in EI mode at 40 eV, using
selected ion monitoring (SIM) at 10,000 resolving power (10% valley). Two ion
current responses corresponding to two masses are monitored for each native
(12C) compound and it corresponding 13C-internal standard. The instrumental
response factor for each analyte is calculated as the sum of the two 12C
isomers divided by the sum of two 13C- isomers.

Calibration of mass spectrometer response factor vs. concentration is
performed using calibration standards containing known concentrations of each
12C compound and its corresponding 13C internal standard. The concentration of
each analyte is derived by interpolation from individual linear calibration
curves and is adjusted for sample weight. The validity of all mass
spectrometry data are evaluated using a variety of established criteria, such
as signal-to-noise ratio ≥ 3 for the smallest native ion mass, instrument
resolving power ≥ 10,000, chromatographic isomer specificity index with 95%
limits, relative retention time ratio of native to isotopically labeled
analyte within 3 parts-per-thousand compared to a standard, response ratios of
the two 12C and 13C ions must be within ± 20 % of their theoretical values and
analyte recovery ≥10 % and ≤ 120%. In addition, the calculated mean and range
of each analyte in the quality control sample must be within their respective
confidence intervals. The method detection limit (MDL) for each analyte is
calculated correcting for sample weight and recovery. The total lipid content
of each specimen is estimated from its total cholesterol and triglycerides
values using a "summation" method. Analytical results for PCBs and pesticides
are reported on a whole-weight [ng/g or parts-per-billion (ppb)] and lipid-
adjusted basis [ng/g or ppb]. International toxicity equivalents (I-TEQs) are
also reported for PCDDs, PCDFs, cPCBs and other "dioxin-like" PCBs, based on
the WHO-TEF system. Prior to reporting results, all quality control (QC) data
undergo a final review by a Division of Laboratory Science quality control
officer.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division
ofLaboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0%of all specimens.

NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocolfor all the
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS and Westat. Summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, are
reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identifiedareas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed.Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard(1981).

## Analytic Notes

Measures of organochlorines are assessed in participants aged 12 years and
older on a one-third subsample.

Use the special weights included in this data file when analyzing data. Read
the "Special Sample Weights for this Dataset" information provided before
beginning analysis.

**Subsample weights**

Measures of organochlorines were measured in a one third subsample of persons
12 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were variable for all of the analytes. The variable named
LBD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection.

The other variable named LBX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.  

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
