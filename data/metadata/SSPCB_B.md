### Non-dioxin-like Polychlorinated Biphenyls - Pooled Samples (Surplus Sera)
(SSPCB_B)

####  Data File: SSPCB_B.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of chlorinated aromatic
hydrocarbon chemicals that once were used as heat-exchanger, transformer, and
hydraulic fluids, and as additives to paints, oils, joint caulking, and floor
tiles. The different types of PCBs are known as congeners, which are compounds
that are distinguished by the number of chlorine atoms and their location on
the biphenyl structure. Peak production occurred in the early 1970s, and
production was banned in the U.S. after 1979. More than 1.5 million pounds of
PCBs were manufactured in the U.S. prior to 1977. Concern about these
chemicals continues because of their persistence in the environment and
accumulation in wildlife and the animal food chain. PCBs enter the food chain
by various routes, including migration into food from external sources,
contamination of animal feeds, and accumulation in the fatty tissues of
animals. PCBs are found a higher concentrations in fatty foods, (e.g., dairy
products and fish), and food is the main source of exposure for the general
population. PCBs can be transferred from mother to infant via breast milk.
Exposure to these chemicals nearly always occurs as mixtures rather than
individual PCB congeners.

## Eligible Sample

Study participants aged 3 years and older from NHANES 2001 - 2002 with stored
serum available to prepare pooled samples.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Twenty nine non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls were measured in serum
by gas chromatography/isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry
(GC/ID-HRMS). The analytical method for PCBs is described in Sjodin et al.,
2004 and Barr et al., 2003. Reported results met the Division of Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision (similar to specifications outlined by Westgard, 1981).

## Data Processing and Editing

Specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to DLS, NCEH, CDC (Atlanta,
Georgia). The analytical approach used, including data processing is described
in detail in Sjodin, et al (2004). Reported results met the Division of
Laboratory Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance
criteria for accuracy and precision (similar to specifications outlined by
Westgard, 1981).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).

Read the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
file for detailed QA/QC protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
_Description of the Laboratory Methodology_ section.

## Analytic Notes

The sampling scheme for NHANES 2001-2002, a complex multistage area
probability design, included 11,039 persons. Data were collected through
household interviews and through standardized physical examinations conducted
in mobile examination centers. On the basis of self-reported data, a composite
race/ethnicity variable helped define three major racial/ethnic groups: non-
Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, and Mexican Americans. Informed consent
was obtained from all study participants. Serum samples used to prepare pools
for analysis were selected from those obtained by venipuncture from 2150
participants, a random one-third subsample of people 12 years of age and older
from NHANES 2001-2002 and representative of the U.S. general population for
this age range. A total of 1,832 individual serum samples were used to prepare
the 54 pooled serum samples analyzed for this subset of NHANES 2001-2002.

After collection of samples, serum specimens were divided into aliquots and
were stored cold (2-4°C) or frozen until they were shipped on dry ice to CDC's
National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH). Serum samples were stored
frozen after receipt at NCEH at -70°C until analyzed. The 2,150 individual
serum samples available were categorized in 24 demographic groups (Table 1),
each representing a combination of race/ethnicity, gender, and age (12-19
years, 20-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60 years and older). The number of
samples available, the number of these samples that were usable, and the
number of pools formed in each demographic group are presented in Table 1. On
the basis of the number of individual serum samples per demographic group,
multiple pools were available for 14 demographic groups, and one pool was
available for 10 demographic groups (Table 1). To ensure that no individual
sample overly influenced the pooled results, all serum samples included in any
one pool (25.5 mL each) were of equal volume (i.e., each individual sample
contributed 750 μL). Most pools included 34 individual serum samples that were
randomly selected. Only 31 individual serum samples were available, however,
for the pool representing non-Hispanic black men 60 years of age or older. In
addition, one of the two pools representing Mexican American men between 20
and 39 years of age consisted of only 33 individual specimens.

In addition, residual serum from 3-11 year old NHANES 2001-2002 participants,
previously analyzed for cotinine, a marker of environmental tobacco smoke, was
used to create pools representing 3-5 year old and 6-11 year old participants.
The 1049 individual samples available were categorized in 12 demographic
groups, each representing a combination of race/ethnicity, sex, and age (3-5
years and 6-11 years). A total of 937 randomly selected individual samples
were used to prepare 24 pools (two per demographic group). The number of
samples available, the number of these samples that were usable, and the
number of pools formed in each demographic group are presented in Table 1. To
ensure that no individual sample overly influenced the pooled results, all
samples included in any one pool were of equal volume (i.e., 0.5 mL). Eleven
of the individual serum samples from non-Hispanic black females 3-5 years of
age contributed <0.5 mL. Each pool included 21 (3-5 year old) or 57 (6-11 year
old) individual samples randomly selected (Table 1).

samples, and number of pools formed from NHANES 2001-2002 participants per
demographic group.

**Guidelines for Working with Pooled-Samples from NHANES 2001-2002**  
Because the samples constituting the pools originated from NHANES 2001-2002,
which was designed to be representative of the non-institutionalized US
population, the pooled results should provide good coverage of the US
population. We cannot be assured, however, that estimates based on the pooled
samples are unbiased for at least two reasons: 1) the sampling weight
information was lost when the samples were pooled because each pool consists
of equal volumes of each sample in the pool; and 2) the measured value for a
pooled sample (consisting of individual samples that tend to be log-normally
distributed) is comparable to an arithmetic average of log-normal results and
thus represents a biased estimate of the central tendency (geometric mean or
median) of the samples making up the pool. Also, because samples were pooled
across the design cells of the original NHANES sampling design, it is not
possible to obtain unbiased estimates of standard errors. These bias and
standard error issues are being addressed in later NHANES surveys involving
pooled samples.

**Pooled-Sample weights**  
The sampling weight information was lost when the samples were pooled because
each pool consists of equal volumes of each sample in the pool.  
  
**Variance estimation**  
The sampling scheme for NHANES 2001-2002 is a complex multistage, probability
sampling design that selects participants who are representative of the
civilian, non-institutionalized U.S. population. Over-sampling of certain
population subgroups is done to increase the reliability and precision of
health status indicator estimates for those groups. For PCBs, instead of using
the full NHANES sample, a random one-third subsample of NHANES participants
was used. Curtin et al. (2012) provide documentation of the construction of
sampling weights for this one-third subsample. Also, because of the use of
stratified multistage selection, incorporation of the sampling design is
needed to calculate sampling variances (NCHS, 1994). These variances cannot be
calculated for NHANES 2001-2002 pooled sample estimates, however, because
samples were pooled across the design cells of the original NHANES 2001-2002
sampling design.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**  
Although this pooled-sample data file cannot be directly linked to other
NHANES 2001-2002 data files, it does contain demographic information
(RIAGENDR, RIDRAETN, and RIDAGGRP) for each pooled-sample.

**Variables in the data file**  
Each variable in the data file is given in Table 2 with its definition. The
definition used for the numeric constant for categorical variables is given in
the column: Definition of Categorical Variables.

The NHANES abbreviation used for each analyte measured with the IUPAC name is
given in Table 3. The code "XYZ" in the variable names "ADJUSTED_RESULT_XYZ"
and "RESULT_COMMENT_XYZ" as defined in Table 2 corresponds to the Value of the
"NHANES code" in Table 3.
