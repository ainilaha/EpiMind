### Perchlorate, Nitrate & Thiocyanate - Urine - Special Sample (PERNTS_G)

####  Data File: PERNTS_G.xpt

## Component Description

**Urinary Perchlorate:** Perchlorate has been used as an oxidant in solid fuel
propellants for rockets and missiles since the 1950s. Lesser amounts of
perchlorate are used in matches and fireworks. Perchlorate can also form
naturally in the environment and can accumulate in nitrate-rich mineral
deposits mined for use in fertilizers. Drinking water, milk, and certain
plants with high water content (e.g., lettuce) can be the main sources of
perchlorate intake for humans. Perchlorate has been used medically to treat
hyperthyroidism. Its inhibitory effect on thyroid hormone production has led
to concerns that exposure even to low levels of perchlorate in the environment
might affect vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women with inadequate iodine
intake and infants for whom thyroid hormone levels must be maintained
adequately for normal brain development. Perchlorate taken into the body is
rapidly eliminated in the urine, within a matter of hours. Measurement of
urinary perchlorate is useful to assess recent human exposure.

**Urinary Nitrate and Thiocyanate:** Nitrate and thiocyanate are polyatomic
anions that can disrupt thyroid function by competitively inhibiting iodide
uptake, similar to the action of perchlorate. Nitrate, thiocyanate, and
perchlorate can reversibly bind to the sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) protein
resulting in reduced iodine absorption by the thyroid. Nitrate, thiocyanate
and perchlorate interact additively to impair iodide uptake by the thyroid.
Therefore, assessment of the impact of perchlorate exposure on thyroid
function should include assessment of nitrate and thiocyanate exposure. By
assessing exposure to each of the three physiologically relevant NIS-
inhibitors, the relative impact of each chemical on thyroid function can be
estimated and appropriate regulatory action taken if exposures are negatively
impacting thyroid hormone levels. Impaired thyroid function can lead to
hypothyroidism, proliferative thyroid lesions, and impaired neurodevelopment
in infants.

Nitrate poisoning can also lead to methemeglobinemia, primarily in infants.
The prevalence of nitrate exposure is likely due to nitrate intake from both
food and drinking water, with foods (e.g. vegetables, milk, dairy products)
thought to account for the majority of nitrate intake for typical American
adults. Nitrate anion can also form endogenously. Public health prevention
efforts have reduced the prevalence of methemoglobinemia in the United States.
A reference range for urinary nitrate will provide useful information relevant
to nitrate poisoning and subclinical methemoglobinemia in the US.

Thiocyanate is also a biomarker of cyanide exposure from tobacco smoke or
diet. Thiocyanate primarily forms in the body as a metabolite of cyanide from
tobacco smoke or cyanogenic foods such as cassava. Exposure to toxic levels of
cyanide can result from numerous chemical reactions. Lower levels of
thiocyanate can also be found in milk, dairy products and some vegetables.
Therefore, a defined reference range for thiocyanate will provide useful
benchmark data in case of a cyanide exposure event.  

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 20 years and older who met the regular one-third subsample
selection criteria were included in the adult special subsample.
Additionally, to augment the adult special subsample, those survey
participants aged 20 years and older, not in the regular one-third subsample,
who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their entire lifetime (SMQ020=1) and now
smoke cigarettes every day (SMQ040=1), were also eligible as an oversampling
of smokers.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Urinary Perchlorate,  Nitrate, and Thiocyanate:** This method is a
quantitative procedure for the measurement of nitrate, perchlorate, and
thiocyanate in human urine using ion chromatography coupled with electrospray
tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation is achieved using an
IonPac AS16 column with sodium hydroxide as the eluent. The eluent from the
column is ionized using an electrospray interface to generate and transmit
negative ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative response
factors (ratio of native analyte to stable isotope labeled internal standard)
with known standard concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations.

Refer to NHANES 2011-2012 [Lab Methods for Perchlorate, Nitrate, and
Thiocyanate](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/labmethods/pernt_g_met.pdf)
for detailed description of the laboratory method used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are stored under appropriate
frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to National Center for
Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample weights**

Urinary perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate were obtained in a one-third
subsample of persons 6 years and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Special weights  
**  
Urinary perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate were measured in a special
smoking sample of persons 20 years and older. Special smoking sample weights
are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

**Variance estimation**  
  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES data files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection limits**  
The lower detection limits were 0.05 ng/mL for urinary perchlorate, 700 ng/mL
for urinary nitrate, and 20 ng/mL for urinary thiocyanate.  
  
In cases, where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for
that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of two.  
  
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1"". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection.  
  
The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
