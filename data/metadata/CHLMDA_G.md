### Chlamydia - Urine (CHLMDA_G)

####  Data File: CHLMDA_G.xpt

##### First Published: November 2013

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Sexually transmitted infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis may lead to
pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic
pelvic pain in women. They are associated with increased risk of HIV
transmission. Pregnant women may transmit infection to their newborn, causing
serious medical complications.

NHANES offers an opportunity to assess the prevalence of chlamydia in the
general population and to monitor trends in prevalence as prevention programs
are established and expanded.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 14-39 years were tested. Public data file includes data for
persons 18-39 years of age. Please see _Analytic Notes_  about the release of
data for adolescents 14-17 years of age.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine specimens were processed, stored and shipped to the Division of STD
Prevention Laboratory, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, SD and
TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis. Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are
discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).

The BDProbeTec CT Chlamydia trachomatis Amplified DNA Assays are based on the
simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA, using amplification
primers and a fluorescent labeled detector probe. The Strand Displacement
Amplification (SDA) reagents are dried in two separate disposable microwell
strips. The processed sample is added to the Priming Microwell, which contains
the amplification primers, fluorescent labeled detector probe, and other
reagents necessary for amplification. After incubation, the reaction mixture
is transferred to the Amplification Microwell, which contains two enzymes (a
DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) necessary for SDA. The
Amplification Microwells are sealed to prevent contamination and then
incubated in a thermally controlled fluorescent reader which monitors each
reaction for the generation of amplified products. There were no changes (from
the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab methods or lab site.

## Data Processing and Editing

The analytical methods are described in the _Analytic Notes_ for Data Users
section below.

Public data files include data for persons 18-39 years of age. Urinary
Chlamydia data for youth 14-17 years of age will only be available in the
Research Data Center (RDC) or through special agreement.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/FASTQX_G.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further details on the use
of sample weights and other analytic issues.

Collaborators may obtain NHANES Adolescent STD Special Use Data file through a
special agreement. The data set is a SAS file containing 2 variables for
examined participants aged 14-17 years. Other interested researchers may use
this file in the NCHS Research Data Center (RDC). The variable descriptors and
variable names are as follows:

Sequence number-Seqn
