### Phthalates & Plasticizers Metabolites - Urine (PHTHTE_G)

####  Data File: PHTHTE_G.xpt

#####  First Published: November 2013

#####  Last Revised: October 2014

## Component Description

Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and
harder to break. They are often called plasticizers. Some phthalates are used
as solvents (dissolving agents) for other materials. They are used in many
products, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, detergents, lubricating oils,
automotive plastics, plastic clothes (raincoats), and personal-care products
(soaps, shampoos, hair sprays, and nail polishes). Phthalates are used widely
in polyvinyl chloride plastics, which are used to make products such as
plastic packaging film and sheets, garden hoses, inflatable toys, blood-
storage containers, and medical tubing. 1,2-Cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid,
diisononyl ester (DINCH) is used as a replacement of some high molecular
weight phthalates. Once phthalates or DINCH enter a person's body, they are
converted into breakdown products (metabolites) that pass out quickly in
urine. Biomeasures of phthalates and phthalates alternatives in humans are
necessary to evaluate potential human health effects from exposure to these
chemicals.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The test principle utilizes high performance liquid chromatography-
electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for the
quantitative detection in urine of the following phthalate metabolites:
monomethyl phthalate (MMP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monobutyl phthalate
(MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MIBP), mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate
(MCPP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP),
monoisononyl phthalate (MNP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP),
mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl)
phthalate (MECPP), monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP), monocarboxynonyl
phthalate (MCNP)), and cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono(hydroxy-
isononyl) ester (MHNCH)  (Silva, et al., 2007). Urine samples are processed
using enzymatic deconjugation of the glucuronidated metabolites followed by
on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed phase HPLC-ESI-
MS/MS. Assay precision is improved by incorporating isotopically-labeled
internal standards of the phthalate metabolites and MHNCH. In addition,
4-methyl umbelliferone glucuronide is used to monitor deconjugation
efficiency. This selective method allows for rapid detection of monoester
metabolites of commonly used phthalate diesters and DINCH in human urine with
limits of detection in the low ng/mL range.

Refer to NHANES 2011-2012 [Lab Methods for Metabolites of Phthalates and
Phthalate
Alternatives](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/labmethods/phthte_g_met.pdf)
for detailed description of the laboratory method used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels are maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules (Westgard, et al., 1981) used
when running NHANES specimens. Any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special
considerations are submitted to NCHS. Summary statistics for each control
pool, QC graphs, are reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The
laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Westgard, et al., 1981).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary phthalates and plasticizers metabolites were measured in a one third
subsample of persons 6 years and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance Estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

****Links to NHANES Data Files****

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes.  The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection.  There
are two values: "0" and "1".  "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection.   "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (i.e., URD___LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt(2)).

The lower limit of detections (LLOD, in ng/mL) for the phthalate metabolites
and MHNCH are:



Analyte | Item ID | LLOD  
---|---|---  
Mono(carboxyoctyl) phthalate | URXCOP | 0.2  
Mono(carboxynonyl) phthalate | URXCNP | 0.2

Mono-n-methyl phthalate | URXMNM | 0.5

Mono-benzyl phthalate | URXMZP | 0.3  
Cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid monohydroxy isononyl ester | URXMHN | 0.4

Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
