## Component Description

The Medical Conditions section (variable name prefix MCQ) provides self-
reported personal interview data on a broad range of health conditions for
both children and adults. Many questions in the NHANES 2001-2002 MCQ section
are also contained in previous NHANES surveys allowing researchers to monitor
health trends over time. The NHANES MCQ questionnaire segment is generally
modeled on the "Medical Conditions" questionnaire section of the U.S. National
Health Interview Survey. In accordance with the Department of Health and Human
Services' Survey Integration Plan, a number of questions on health conditions
are in fact identical to those used in the redesigned National Health
Interview Survey adult and child core sections that started in 1997.

**Topics Included in the Section:**

**Health Conditions / Medical History:**

  * Asthma, Childhood and Adult 
  * Anemia Angina 
  * Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) 
  * Arthritis (Rheumatoid & Osteoarthritis) 
  * Blood Transfusions 
  * Cancer (Multiple Varieties) 
  * Chronic Bronchitis 
  * Congestive Heart Failure 
  * Coronary Heart Disease 
  * Ear Infections 
  * Emphysema 
  * Hay Fever 
  * Headache 
  * Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction) 
  * Lead Poisoning Testing 
  * Learning Disability 
  * Liver Disease 
  * Menses Onset 
  * Overweight 
  * Stroke 
  * Stuttering/Stammering 
  * Thyroid problems 
  * Vision difficulties 

**Family History of Disease:**

  * Alzheimer's Disease 
  * Asthma 
  * Diabetes

  * Hip Fracture in Mother 
  * Osteoporosis 

**Questions Regarding Twelve Month Period Prevalence of Disablement:**

  * Respondent Missed School Because of Illness or Injury (Children) 
  * Respondent Missed Job Because of Illness or Injury (Adults) 

**Links to examination and laboratory data:**

A number of additional questions occur in MCQ that are logically related to
other questionnaire sections or exam segments. Analysts should refer to these
other NHANES sections as a part of any data analysis.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed and edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical  
values.

**MCQ025 Age when first had asthma.**

4 zero values were changed to 'don't know', since the youngest allowable age
for this question was 1. In one instance, the age of asthma diagnosis was
greater than the respondent's current age and the value for this variable was
adjusted to the current age.

**MCQ180A Age when told you had arthritis.**

In one instance, the age of arthritis diagnosis was greater than the
respondent's current age and the value for this variable was adjusted to the
current age.

**MCD147 Menstrual periods started yet?**

The numbering of this question was changed in 2002 when the follow up question
of how old respondent was at menarche was dropped, although no changes to the
wording of this question were made. MCD147 is a combination of the old and new
variables corresponding to this question.

**Thyroid Questions (MCD160M, MCD170M, MCD180M):**

In 2002, one general question about thyroid problems was substituted for the
previous 2 questions regarding goiter and other thyroid disease. The data from
the two thyroid questions asked in 2001 were edited to be comparable to the
thyroid problems data from 2002 in the following manner: A 'yes' for either of
the 2 thyroid questions was coded as 'yes'. A 'no' for both was coded as 'no'.
A 'don't know' for both was coded as 'don't know'. A 'no' for one question and
a 'don't know' for the other was coded as 'don't know'. If one of the two
responses was missing, the value of the other response was retained.

For the age at which thyroid problems were diagnosed, if there were two
different ages for each of the questions, the lowest age value was retained.

## Analytic Notes

The age group asked follow up questions on asthma was changed between the
1999-2000 data collection and the 2001-2002 data collection. The questions
regarding how old a respondent was when first told he/she had asthma and
whether the respondent still has asthma were asked of 1-19 year olds only in
1999-2000 and were asked of all ages in 2001-2002. When combining the two
datasets, the age groups asked the questions should be taken into
consideration.

A number of questions asked in the MCQ section for 1999-2000 were not
continued in this section for 2001-2002. These include:

  * History of chicken pox 
  * History of childhood hypertension and hypertension medication 
  * Age at menarche (age < 12 years) 
  * History of peptic ulcer 
  * Family history of arthritis 

Questions on family history of prostate cancer were added to this section in
2002. These data are not included in the public release to eliminate the
disclosure risk of releasing data collected in only one of the two years.
