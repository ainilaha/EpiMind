### Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry - Spine (DXXSPN_J)

####  Data File: DXXSPN_J.xpt

##### First Published: May 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Users of the 2017-2018 dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry spine bone data
(DXXSPN_J) are encouraged to read the documentation before accessing the data
file.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is the most widely accepted method of
measuring bone density due in part to its speed, ease of use, and low
radiation exposure (Baran, 1997; Genant, 1996; Heymsfield, 1989; and Njeh,
1999). DXA scans of the lumbar spine have been administered in the NHANES
mobile examination center (MEC) from 2005-2010, 2013-2014, and 2017-2018.

The spine scans provide bone measurements for the total spine and vertebrae L1
â L4. Measurements include:

  * Bone mineral content (BMC) (gm) 
  * Bone area (cm2) 
  * Bone mineral density (BMD) (gm/cm2) 

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 50 years of age and over were eligible. Pregnant females
were excluded from the DXA examination. Participants who were excluded from
the DXA examination for reasons other than pregnancy were eligible
nonrespondents. Reasons for exclusion from the DXA examination were as
follows:

  * Pregnancy (positive urine pregnancy test and/or self-report at the time of the DXA examination). 
  * Self-reported history of radiographic contrast material (barium) use in past 7 days. 
  * Measured weight over 450 pounds (DXA table limitation). 

Participants were excluded from the spine scan if they reported a Harrington
Rod in the spine for scoliosis.

The variable DXASPNST indicates the examination status for the spine scan. The
codes for DXASPNST are as follows:

DXASPNST â spine scan examination status variable  
1 = Spine scan completed, and all vertebrae are valid  
2 = Spine scan completed, but one or more vertebrae are invalid  
4 = Spine not scanned, weight > 450 lbs  
5 = Spine not scanned, other reason

The main reasons for completed, but invalid, spine scans were an insufficient
scan area or partial scan, degenerative disease/severe scoliosis, and
sclerotic spine/spinal fusion/laminectomy. The âNot scanned, other reasonâ
code includes no time to complete the examination, pregnancy test not
completed, and participant refusal, as well as exclusion for reasons other
than pregnancy, such as a medical test.



## Protocol and Procedure

The spine scans were acquired on Hologic Discovery model A densitometers
(Hologic, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts), using software version Apex 3.2. The
radiation exposure from DXA for the spine scan is extremely low at less than
20 uSv. All scans in the DXXSPN_J file were analyzed with Hologic APEX version
4.0 software.

The DXA examinations were administered by trained and certified radiology
technologists. Further details of the DXA examination protocol are documented
in [the Body Composition Procedures Manual
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/Body_Composition_Procedures_Manual_2018.pdf)on
the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

A high level of quality control was maintained throughout the DXA data
collection and scan analysis, including a rigorous phantom scanning schedule.

**Monitoring of Field Staff and Densitometers**  
Staff from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the NHANES
data collection contractor monitored technologist acquisition performance
through in-person observations in the field. Retraining sessions were
conducted with the technologists annually and as needed to reinforce correct
techniques and appropriate protocol. In addition, technologist performance
codes were recorded by the NHANES quality control center Shepherd Research Lab
at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department of Radiology
(2017) and at the University of Hawaii (UH) Cancer Center (2018) during review
of participant scans. The codes documented when the technologist had deviated
from acquisition procedures and where scan quality could have been improved.
The performance codes were tracked for each technologist individually and a
summary was reported to NCHS on a quarterly basis. Additional feedback on
technologist performance was provided by the Shepherd Research Lab when
problems were noted during review of the scans. Constant communication was
maintained throughout the year among the Shepherd Research Lab, the NCHS, and
the data collection contractor regarding any issues that arose.

Hologic service engineers performed all routine densitometer maintenance and
repairs. Copies of all reports completed by the manufacturerâs service
engineers were sent to the quality control center when the scanners were
serviced or repaired so any changes in measurement as a result of the work
could be assessed.

**Scan Analysis**  
Each participant scan and phantom scan was reviewed and analyzed by the
Shepherd Research Lab using standard radiologic techniques and study-specific
protocols developed for the NHANES. The Hologic software, APEX verson 4.0
(Hologic) was used to analyze all spine scans acquired in 2017-18. Expert
review was conducted by the Shepherd Research Lab on 100% of analyzed
participant scans to verify the accuracy and consistency of the results.

**Invalidity Codes**  
Invalidity codes were applied by the Shepherd Research Lab to indicate the
reasons spine regions of interest (ROI) could not be analyzed accurately. The
invalidity codes are provided in the data file (see Data Processing and
Editing section for a more detailed description of the invalidity codes).

**Quality Control Scans**  
The quality control phantoms were scanned according to a predetermined
schedule. The Hologic Anthropomorphic Spine Phantom that traveled with each
MEC was scanned daily as required by the manufacturer to ensure accurate
calibration of the densitometer. The Hologic Femur Phantom was scanned once
each week. A Hologic Spine (HSP-Q96) Phantom and a Hologic Block Phantom
circulated among the MECs and were scanned at the start of operations at each
survey site.

The complete phantom scanning schedule is described in the Body Composition
Procedures Manual on the NHANES website.

In 2017-2018, longitudinal monitoring was conducted through daily spine
phantom scans as required by the manufacturer and through the once weekly
femur phantom scans in order to correct any scanner-related changes in
participant data. The circulating HSP-Q96 and block phantoms, which were
scanned at the start of operations at each site, provided additional data for
use in longitudinal monitoring and cross calibration.

The Shepherd Research Lab used the Cumulative Statistics method (CUSUM) and
the MEC-specific phantom data to determine breaks in the calibration of the
densitometers over the course of the survey (Lu, 1996). No shifting or
drifting of the MEC-specific spine phantom values was found for any of the
three MECs during 2017-2018. Therefore, no corrections to the participant data
were needed. Comparison of data for the phantoms that circulated among the
MECs indicated no statistically significant differences so that data from the
three MECs could be combined.

Several data quality issues were addressed through the quality control
program. Direct feedback given to the technologists regarding acquisition
problems affecting the quality of the scans and yearly refresher training
resulted in improved technologist performance. The rigorous schedule of
quality control scans provided continuous monitoring of machine performance.
The expert review procedures helped to ensure that scan analysis was accurate
and consistent.



## Data Processing and Editing

During the editing process, data were reviewed for completeness, consistency,
and outliers. Back-end edits of the data were performed when errors were
identified.

**Invalidity Codes**  
Invalidity codes were included in the data file to indicate the reasons and
spine regions of interest (ROI) could not be analyzed accurately. Invalidity
codes were applicable to completed scans only (DXASPNST = 1 or 2). If a
participant was not scanned, all invalidity codes are missing.

The invalidity codes are provided in the data file as follows:

Invalidity codes  
DXXOSBCC = total spine BMD  
DXXL1BCC = L1 vertebra BMD  
DXXL2BCC = L2 vertebra BMD  
DXXL3BCC = L3 vertebra BMD  
DXXL4BCC = L4 vertebra BMD

Values for DXXL1BCC, DXXL2BCC, DXXL3BCC, DXXL4BCC  
0 = Valid data  
1 = Removable or non-removable objects  
3 = Excessive x-ray ânoiseâ due to obesity  
4 = Insufficient scan area  
5 = Movement  
6 = (degenerative diseases, spinal fusion, fractures)

Values for DXXOSBCC  
0 = valid data  
1 = invalid data

If one or more spine vertebrae were coded as invalid, total spine BMD was
coded as invalid (DXXOSBCC = 1) and all spine data were set to missing.

## Analytic Notes

The NHANES examination sample weights should be used for any analyses using
the DXXSPN_J data. Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the on-line
[NHANES Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. Both
of these are available on the the [NHANES
website](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).
