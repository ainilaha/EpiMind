### Oral Health - Dentition (OHXDEN_H)

####  Data File: OHXDEN_H.xpt

##### First Published: August 2016

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

NHANES is critical for monitoring oral health status, risk indicators for
disease, and access to preventive and treatment services. Oral health data
from NHANES may be used for:

  * Assessing the prevalence of major oral health diseases and conditions including dental caries, periodontal disease, and dental fluorosis; 
  * Assessing prevention and treatment efforts including the prevalence of dental sealants; 
  * Informing specific public health programs, policies, or initiatives; 
  * Monitoring the oral health status of minority/underserved populations; 
  * Evaluating **_Healthy People_** objectives related to oral health; and 
  * Supporting research activities as identified in the 2000 Surgeon General's Report on **_Oral Health in the United States._**

The oral health examination component provides information on a number of oral
health topics including tooth count, dental caries, dental sealants, dental
fluorosis, periodontal pockets, recession, and loss of attachment, and
recommendations for dental care. These data are released in multiple data
files.

This data documentation specifically provides information on the following
three data files:

  * Dentition Exam (OHXDEN_H) - Includes data on tooth count, dental caries, and dental sealants. 
  * Periodontal Exam (OHXPER_H) - Includes data on periodontal pockets, recession, and loss of attachment. 
  * Recommendation of Care (OHXREF_H) - Includes data on dental care recommendations and exam position. 

In 2013-2014, a dental fluorosis clinical assessment was also conducted as
part of the NHANES oral health exam. The fluorosis data are available in
separate datasets. Fluorosis clinical assessment data from participants aged
6-19 years are available publically through the NHANES website (i.e.,
Fluorosis - Clinical, FLXCLN_G). Fluorosis clinical data collected in 2014 for
participants aged 20-29 years are available through the NCHS Research Data
Center (i.e., Fluorosis - Clinical 20-29 Years, FLXC_H_R), due to disclosure
concerns. For more information on the dental fluorosis clinical assessment
data, please refer to the documentation accompanying these datasets.

In addition to the oral health examination data, oral health questionnaire
data are collected during the household interview. For information on these
data please refer to the documentation for the Oral Health Questionnaire (OHQ)
section.

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants 1 year and older were eligible for the oral health
examination.

Participants aged 30 years and older were eligible for the periodontal
examination if they had one or more natural teeth and no health condition
requiring antibiotic prophylaxis before periodontal probing. Based on the 2008
American Dental Association guidelines, participants who reported that they
had a heart transplant, an artificial heart valve, congenital heart disease
(not including mitral valve prolapse), or ever had bacterial endocarditis were
excluded from the periodontal examination.

## Protocol and Procedure

The oral health examination was conducted by dental examiners, who were
dentists (D.D.S./D.M.D.) licensed in at least one U.S. state. A health
technician assisted in entering all examiner observations directly into a
computerized data collection system. All oral health assessments took place in
a designated room at the mobile examination center (MEC) that included a
portable dental chair, light, and compressed air.

For all survey participants aged 1 and older, the oral health examination
began with a tooth count assessment. Next, their teeth were assessed for
dental caries, including untreated dental decay and teeth treated or extracted
due to caries. For children and adolescents aged 3 to 19 years, eligible teeth
were assessed for the presence of dental sealants. In 2013-2014, the tooth
count, dental caries, and dental sealants assessments followed the same
protocols conducted in 1999-2004 and 2011-2012.

Adults aged 30 years and older were eligible for a full-mouth periodontal
examination (FMPE) that included an assessment of gingival recession and
pocket depth measures. The FMPE protocol was introduced in NHANES in 2009-2010
and has remained the same through 2013-2014.

Please refer to the [NHANES Oral Health Examiners Manual
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/Oral_Health_Examiners.pdf)for
detailed information regarding data collection protocols for the 2013-2014
oral health component.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The specific QA practices for the oral health examination are documented in
detail in the[ NHANES Oral Health Examiners
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/Oral_Health_Examiners.pdf).

All dental examiners received an initial training, which consisted of lecture,
model review, practice simulations and standardization sessions. Following
successful initial training, examiners received field training at the MEC
consisting of more practice simulation, standardization, and calibration
sessions.

There are three main activities employed to facilitate the ongoing collection
of quality oral health data on NHANES. To reduce data recording errors, all
data are directly entered into an electronic data management system and
automated data management utilities are used to check for out of range values
at the time of entry. NHANES staff periodically conduct observations of the
data collection to ensure that protocols are followed. Finally, the reference
examiner visits each dental examiner 2-3 times a year and conducts about 20
replicate exams during each visit. Data from these replicate exams were used
to produce inter-rater reliability statistics to objectively evaluate examiner
agreement. Although dental examiners were aware of the inter-rater evaluations
being conducted, examiners are blinded to each other's observations. Because
all inter-rater reliability statistics were calculated after the MEC
evaluation visits, the findings were unavailable for real time use. However,
all examiners did receive general feedback pertaining to their performance
immediately following each evaluation visit by the reference examiner. An
annual retraining session was conducted to reinforce existing protocols and to
introduce protocol updates, if needed.

Inter-rater reliability statistics including percent agreement, Kappa
statistics, and inter-class correlation coefficients for the 2011-2014 oral
health data are available elsewhere (Dye et al., 2019).

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked and data values were reviewed prior to data
release.

## Analytic Notes

The dentition, periodontal, and recommendation of care data files can be
linked using the unique survey participant identifier, SEQN. In addition to
the examination data, self-reported data on oral health related topics are
available in the Oral Health questionnaire (OHQ) section collected as part of
the household interview. These data can be linked using the SEQN as well.
Although the OHQ data were collected as part of the household questionnaire,
if they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used
for the analyses. Please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines and the
online NHANES Tutorial for further details on the use of sample weights and
other analytic issues.

If data from this release are combined with oral health data from previous
data cycles for analyses, users should understand that methodological
differences (in data collection) may exist among similar, earlier assessments
and may bias the analysis conducted.
