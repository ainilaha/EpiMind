### Weight History (P_WHQ)

####  Data File: P_WHQ.xpt

##### First Published: November 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

The Weight History section of the Sample Person Questionnaire (variable name
prefix WHQ) provides personal interview data on several topics related to body
weight, including self-perception of weight, self-reported weight over the
participant's lifetime, attempted weight loss during the past 12 months, and
methods used to try to lose weight and to keep from gaining weight.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 16 years and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic sample were eligible. However, eligibility varies by age for some
questions. Please review the codebook carefully. Frequency counts were
verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

Trained interviewers asked these questions, in the home, using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system.

For details on the administration of the WHQ_J, please refer to the Weight
History Sample Person Questionnaire on the [NHANES
website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2017).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to some variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and
analytic usefulness of the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to
address data disclosure concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as
part of the editing process, the third letter in the variable name was changed
from a Q (i.e., WHQ) to a D (i.e., WHD). For example, height data were
collected as feet and inches, but standardized to inches using the conversion
factors 0.3937 inches per centimeter and 12 inches per foot. Current and past
self-reported weights were standardized to weight in pounds using the
conversion factor 2.2046 pounds per kilogram.

Reported heights and weights, considered being physiologically implausible or
the result of interviewer data entry error, were coded as "missing."

If maximum weight (WHQ150) extended over more than one year, the interviewer
recorded the most recent age at which the survey participant reported that
weight.

All responses to WHQ150 (age when weighed the most) of 80 years and older were
coded as "80" to be consistent with the way age of the survey participant was
coded in the demographic file.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. The resulting
sample weights in the demographic file should be used to calculate estimates
from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate for
independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Although data in this file were collected as part of the household interview,
if they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used
for analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
