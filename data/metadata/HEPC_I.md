### Hepatitis C: RNA (HCV-RNA) and Hepatitis C Genotype (HEPC_I)

####  Data File: HEPC_I.xpt

##### First Published: September 2017

##### Last Revised: September 2017

##### Note: The confirmatory test for the Hepatitis C screening test was
discontinued by the manufacturer in 2012. A new confirmatory test (HCV
INNO_LIA) to confirm Hepatitis C antibody (Anti-HCV) was implemented/validated
and will be released in the RDC (SSHEPC_I).

## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the
United States. Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and
control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of
asymptomatic infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of
these diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a
nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide
the most reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will
be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.

In 2013, CDC revised its guidelines for Hepatitis C (HCV) testing because of
1) changes in the availability of certain commercial HCV antibody tests; 2)
evidence that many persons who are identified as reactive by an HCV antibody
test might not subsequently be evaluated to determine if they have current HCV
infection; and 3) there have been significant advances in the development of
antiviral agents with improved efficacy against HCV.1 This new guidance was
adopted in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle, and is reflected in the following
datasets:

**2013-2014:** SSHEPC_H (HCV confirmatory antibody - INNO-LIA) and HEPC_H (HCV
RNA & Genotype)

**2015-2016:** SSHC_I_R (2015 HCV confirmatory antibody - INNO-LIA), HEPC_I_R
(2016 HCV confirmatory antibody - INNO-LIA) and HEPC_I (HCV RNA & Genotype)

The flow chart for the new Hepatitis C algorithm can be found in the
laboratory method file or by following the MMWR link below.

**Beginning in the 2017-2018 cycle, the HCV confirmatory antibody test (INNO-
LIA) will be released in the HEPC dataset with HCV RNA and Genotype data.**

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA)**

The COBAS AMPLICOR HCV MONITOR Test, version 2 0 (v2.0) is an in vitro nucleic
acid amplification test for the quantitation of Hepatitis C Virus RNA in human
serum or plasma on the COBAS AMPLICOR Analyzer.

**Hepatitis C genotype**

The VERSANT ® HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay (LiPA) is a line probe assay designed to
identify Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 to 6 in human serum or EDTA
plasma samples. Subtype information is available in the majority of cases.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle. However, the confirmatory test for
the Hepatitis C screening test was discontinued by the manufacturer in 2012,
and a new confirmed Hepatitis C antibody (Anti-HCV) will be retested by
another confirmatory test (INNO-LIA HCV Score Test) and released at a later
date in the [RDC](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral
Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).  

**Detection Limits**

This data is qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
