### Heterocyclic Aromatic Amines - Urine (HCAA_H)

####  Data File: HCAA_H.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2017

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCAA) are an important class of carcinogens
formed during combustion of cigarettes and cooking meats at high temperature
(Turesky, R.J., Zhang, L., et al.). Studies have shown that HCAAs have a
potential impact on human health, and in particular, on cancer risk due to
frequent exposure. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has
considered a number of HCAAs as possible and probable carcinogens.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Heterocyclic aromatic amines in urine are measured by an isotope-dilution
high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (ID HPLC-ESI MS/MS). For "total" HCAA assays, the urine samples
are fortified with internal standards (ISTD), and hydrolyzed in basic
condition at 70°C for 5 hours. The samples are then extracted by solid phase
extraction, after which the analytes are eluted and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The
analyte specific ion transitions are monitored for HCAA quantitation,
confirmation and ISTD respectively. The concentrations are derived from their
respective ratios of native to isotope-labeled ions in the samples by
comparing to their standard curves.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.  

## Laboratory Method Files

(HCAA)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/HCAA_H_MET.pdf)
(September 2017)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Tobacco and Volatile Branch, Division of
Laboratory Services quality control and quality assurance performance criteria
for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al.,
2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Heterocyclic aromatic amines were measured in a special smoking subsample of
persons 18 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDAACLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDAACLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXAAC) provides the
analytic result for that analyte.

**Lower Limit of Detection (LLOD, in pg/mL) for Heterocyclic Aromatic
Amines:**
