### Varicella-Zoster Virus Antibody (Surplus) (SSVARI_A)

####  Data File: SSVARI_A.xpt

##### First Published: March 2009

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Measurement of varicella-zoster virus antibodies from stored sera specimens.

## Eligible Sample

Participants 6 - 19 years of age from NHANES 1999-2004 with stored sera. All
specimens from subjects aged 6 - 19 years that initially tested (via whole-
cell EIA test) negative (N=649) for varicella antibodies and a random
selection of specimens that initially tested positive (N=300).

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Measurement of IgG antibody to varicella-zoster virus. The presence of IgG
antibody to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the re-tested specimens was
measured using an enzyme immunoassay (gp-ELISA) developed by the staff of the
National VZV Laboratory at CDC. This method has been validated against a
number of other laboratory-based VZV serologic methods and performs comparably
to all of them (manuscript in preparation). Lentil-lectin-purified
glycoprotein antigens derived from VZV-infected human fibroblast cells
(obtained through CRADA with Merck & Co.) is coated on the wells of a 96-well
microtiter plate, which is subsequently incubated with a diluted test
specimen. Control (normal tissue) antigen (also obtained from Merck & Co.) is
also prepared from uninfected fibroblasts and is plated separately into
different wells and incubated with test serum to account for any nonspecific
antibody reactivity. After unbound serum components are removed by washing, an
antibody-enzyme conjugate, consisting of anti-human IgG antibody coupled to
alkaline phosphatase, is added to wells and incubated. The conjugate binds
only to human IgG antibodies that are in turn bound to the antigen coated on
the plates. A colorimetric substrate for the enzyme is added to the wells and
incubated for a sufficient time to permit color development, at which point
the reaction is stopped chemically. The enzyme-substrate reaction results in a
yellow-colored product that can be measured using a spectrophotometer set to a
wavelength of 405 nm.

Raw data are transferred electronically from instrument readout files into a
computerized spreadsheet. This spreadsheet is designed for the management of
CDC National VZV Laboratory test results. It functions within the Excel
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmund, WA) software program. For VZV gp-ELISA test
results, adjusted mean test optical density readings are recorded (average
optical density from two normal tissue control wells, is subtracted from the
average optical density from two test antigen wells). Positive test cut-offs
were established empirically by analyzing operator and test variation of
results from 16 serum specimens (8 positive, 8 negative) tested twice a day
(two different operators) on three different days. Internal standards (strong
positive, weak positive, negative) are run on each test plate.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data was received after all the laboratory testing was complete. The data were
not edited.

Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

See description above.

## Analytic Notes

There are 2 variables:

Sequence Number

Varicella Antibody Test Result  
1=positive  
2=negative  
3=equivocal
