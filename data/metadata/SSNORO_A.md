### Norovirus antibody - Serum (SSNORO_A)

####  Data File: SSNORO_A.xpt

##### First Published: July 2017

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (10-<15% of records) that were initially included
in error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall
estimates were compared between the original and revised files. The sample
weights provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with
this updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The
overall estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the
previous file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any
queries related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at
serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

Sera from residual specimens from NHANES 1999-2000 participants were tested
for IgG antibodies against seven norovirus strains: GI.1 Norwalk, GI.4, GII.3,
GII.4 US95/96, GII.4 Farmington Hills, GII.4 New Orleans, and GIV.1. A
quantitative enzyme immunoassay that uses norovirus virus-like particles
(VLPs) to detect anti-norovirus IgG was used. Samples were diluted 1:50 for
analysis. The results are reported in optical density (OD) and ng IgG/ml.
Samples with OD >3 (i.e. above the measurable range of the assay, strongly
positive) are reported as 3.50. Samples with OD less than the plate blank are
coded 0.00. Concentrations greater than the highest standard (2000 ng IgG/ml)
are reported as 100,000 ng IgG/ml, the upper limit of detection. Missing
observations represent samples that could not be tested due to insufficient
volume or technical errors.

## Eligible Sample

These tests were conducted on residual serum specimens stored at NCHS.
Specimens were collected during the 1999-2000 study cycle. A one-third
subsample of all subjects aged 16-49, maintaining population
representativeness, was tested for anti-norovirus IgG antibody.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Anti-norovirus IgG was measured using a previously published enzyme
immunoassay (EIA) and virus-like particles (VLPs) as antigen. VLPs were
provided by Dr. Robert Atmar at Baylor University. The EIA test utilizes VLP-
coated wells. The serum samples were diluted 1:50 and incubated in the
antigen-coated wells. If present, anti-norovirus antibodies are immobilized in
the wells. Residual sample is eliminated by washing and conjugate (enzyme
labeled antibodies to human IgG) is added and incubated. If IgG antibodies to
norovirus are present, the conjugate will be immobilized in the wells.
Residual conjugate is eliminated by washing and the enzyme substrate
(p-nitrophenyl phosphate) is added. In the presence of the enzyme, the
substrate is converted to a yellow end product which is read photometrically.
Each sample was tested in duplicate.  

Each plate had an IgG standard curve with known concentrations of human IgG
ranging from 2000 ng/ml to 31.25 ng/ml. The standards were run in duplicate on
each plate and the average of the duplicates was used to generate the standard
curve. The curve was fit using a 4-point parametric fit in the Gen5 software
and this curve was used to calculate concentrations for the samples on the
same plate. Concentrations in ng IgG/ml were calculated for each well and
averaged across the duplicates. Extrapolation beyond the standard curve was
not allowed.  

Optical density was determined on a BioTek ELx800 microplate reader and
computer equipped with Gen5 software (BioTek, Winooski, VT).  

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Quality control samples specific to each VLP antigen were included on every
plate. Human serum from subjects with norovirus infections strain-matched to
the assay VLPs was used as a positive control for all VLPs except GIV.1. For
GIV.1, serum with high reactivity to GIV.1 (kind gift from B. di Martino) was
used as a positive control because serum from subjects with known GIV.1
infections was not available. Negative control serum was selected from a panel
of sera from uninfected subjects in norovirus human challenge studies. The
serum sample with the lowest reactivity across all seven VLPs was used as the
assay negative control.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data was compiled after all the antibody testing was completed. Values above
the upper limit of detection (OD = 3.0 or concentration = 100,000 ng IgG/ml)
were replaced with 3.5 or 100,000, respectively. Values that were less than
the plate blank were replaced with 0. Mean OD and concentration values were
calculated using the replacement values.Data Access: All data are publicly
available.

## Analytic Notes

Due to cross-reactivity between strains and declining antibody levels after
infection, there is no standard cutpoint value to determine seropositivity to
norovirus in a single serum sample. Based on results of previous human
challenge studies, a cutpoint of OD=1.5 is suggested to distinguish
seropositive from seronegative samples. Additionally, an OD â‰¥3 (represented by
a value of 3.50) is suggested to identify samples with recent (within the last
year) infections.  

Parallel analysis using the same selection and assay criteria was performed on
serum samples from the 2003-2004 study cycle.
