### Mental Health - Depression Screener (DPQ_I)

####  Data File: DPQ_I.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2017

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

A nine-item depression screening instrument (variable name prefix DPQ), also
called the Patient Health Questionnaire (Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002; Kroenke et
al., 2001) was administered to determine the frequency of depression symptoms
over the past 2 weeks. A follow-up question assessed the overall impairment of
the symptoms. Response categories for the nine-item instrument "not at all,"
"several days," "more than half the days," and "nearly every day" were given a
point ranging from 0 to 3. The instrument incorporates DSM-IV depression
diagnostic criteria (Spitzer et al.1999).

## Eligible Sample

Mobile Examination Center (MEC) participants 12 years and older were eligible.
Only data from participants aged 18 and older are included in this data file.
Participants requiring a proxy were not eligible because of the sensitive
nature of the questions. Data for youth aged 12-17 years are available through
the NCHS Research Data Center only.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The questions were asked at the MEC, by trained interviewers, using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system as part of the MEC
interview.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure completeness, consistency and analytic usefulness of
the data.

## Analytic Notes

A total score is based on the sum of the points in each item ranging from 0 to
27. Major depression and depression severity can be assessed using pre-defined
cut-points, described in the references that follow.

The NHANES full sample 2-Year MEC Exam Weights (WTMEC2YR) should be used to
analyze the 2015-2016.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
