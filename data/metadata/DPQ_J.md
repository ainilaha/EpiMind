### Mental Health - Depression Screener (DPQ_J)

####  Data File: DPQ_J.xpt

##### First Published: February 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

A nine-item depression screening instrument (variable prefix is DPQ), also
called the Patient Health Questionnaire (Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002; Kroenke et
al., 2001) was administered to determine the frequency of depression symptoms
over the past 2 weeks. For each symptom question, points ranging from 0 to 3,
are associated with the response categories "not at all," "several days,"
"more than half the days," and "nearly every day." This screening instrument
incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria (Spitzer et al.,1999).

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and over were eligible. Only data from participants
aged 18 and older are included in this data file. Participants requiring a
proxy were not eligible because of the sensitive nature of the questions. Data
for youth aged 12-17 years are available through the NCHS Research Data
Center.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The questions were asked at the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), by trained
interviewers, using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system as
part of the MEC interview.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure completeness, consistency and analytic usefulness of
the data.

## Analytic Notes

A total score, ranging from 0 to 27, can be calculated for persons who have
complete responses to the symptom questions. Major depression and depression
severity can be assessed using pre-defined cut-points, described in the
references that follow.

The NHANES full sample 2-Year MEC Exam Weights (WTMEC2YR) should be used to
analyze these data.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
