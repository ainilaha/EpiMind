### Weight History - Youth (WHQMEC_I)

####  Data File: WHQMEC_I.xpt

##### First Published: April 2018

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Weight History section of the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) Interview
(variable name prefix WHQMEC) provides personal interview data on topics
related to body weight in youth 8-15 years of age. These topics include self-
perception of weight and dieting attempts.

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for the questions in this section is youth, aged 8-15 years.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The questions were asked in the MEC, by trained interviewers, using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system as part of the MEC
interview. Proxy respondents were not permitted for this section.

For details on the administration of WHQMEC_I, refer to the [NHANES 2015-2016
MEC Interviewers Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_Interviewer_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and the [2015-2016 Weight History
Questionnaire](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/questionnaires/WHQ_CAPI_I.pdf)
on the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

For details on the quality assurance/quality control process for this
component, please refer to the NHANES 2015-16 MEC Interviewer Procedures
Manual.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of the file.

Responses to WHQ030m, which asks if adolescents consider themselves now to be
fat or overweight, too thin, or about the right weight, can be compared with
proxy responses to WHQ030e in the Early Childhood questionnaire (ECQ) section.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

## Analytic Notes

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
