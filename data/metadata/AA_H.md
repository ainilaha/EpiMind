### Aromatic Amines - Urine (AA_H)

####  Data File: AA_H.xpt

##### First Published: February 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The specific aims of the component are: 1) to measure the prevalence and
extent of tobacco use; 2) to estimate the extent of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), and determine trends in exposure to ETS; and 3) to
describe the relationship between tobacco use (as well as exposure to ETS) and
chronic health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Aromatic amines are classified as carcinogens or possible carcinogens (Hammond
SK, et al., 1993; Perera FP, et al., 1987; Skipper PL, et al., 1994; Wishnok
JS, et al., 1992; Skipper PL, et al., 1994; and Maclure M, et al., 1989). The
International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified several AAs
as carcinogenic to humans (group 1), or possibly carcinogenic to humans (group
2B). AAs such as o-toluidine, 2-aminonapthalene, and 4-aminobiphenyl, for
example, are well-established human bladder carcinogens (IARC, 2010; Bartsch,
H., et. al, 1990; Bryant, M.S., et. al, 1987). Aromatic amines are metabolized
mainly in the liver, then travels to the bladder to be eventually excreted out
of the body through urination. The amine functional groups may be metabolized
in the liver to the acetylated and / or glucuronidated forms, or they may be
oxidized to a hydroxylamine form, which undergoes further conversion via an
acetylation reaction to form a N-acetoxy metabolite. The N-acetoxy metabolite
is able to undergo non-enzymatic breakdown to yield the reactive nitrenium
ion, nitrene or a free radical that can covalently bind to tissue
macromolecules (proteins) and DNA to form adducts (IARC, 2000; Riedel, K., et.
al, 2006; Talaska, G. Zoughool, M. A., 2003). Formation of the hydroxylamine
metabolite is considered the primary pathway to AA carcinogenicity in the
target organs (e.g., bladder) (Bryant MS, et al., 1987 and Bryant MS, et al.,
1993). The acetylated and glucuronidated forms of AAs, which are excreted
directly in urine, are the products of the body's detoxification metabolism
pathway. Consequently, total urinary concentrations of aromatic amines (free,
acetylated and glucuronidated Aas) are effective surrogate biomarkers of AAs
exposure or carcinogenic metabolites at the target tissues (bladder, liver,
kidney, pancreas, spleen, thyroid, etc.).

Several AAs are on the FDA's list of harmful and potentially harmful
constituents (HPHCs) since the passage of The Family Smoking Prevention and
Tobacco Control Act in 2009 and the creation of the Center of Tobacco Products
(USHHS, 2012). Smoking tobacco and inhaling SHS may be major sources of
exposure to several aromatic amines (AAs) (Bryant, et. al, 1988; Castelao, J.
E., et. al, 2001; Vineis, P., 1994), which are suggested to be principal
agents for the development of bladder cancer in humans (IARC, 2010). AAS are
present in mainstream and side stream tobacco smoke, with the latter
containing up to thirty times as much 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) as mainstream
smoke (Bryant MS, et al., 1987 and Bryant MS, et al., 1993). The total
nitrogen content in tobacco leaves--as derived from nitrates, ammonia, amino
acids, amides and alkaloids--ultimately contributes to the formation of AAs in
tobacco smoke (Stabbert, R., et. al, 2003; Fischer, P., 1999; Dawson, R. F.,
1952). Nitrate, which is introduced to the growing tobacco plant through the
application of fertilizer, can be converted to ammonia, which, in turn, is
converted to other nitrogenous organic compounds such as amino acids.
Intermediate NH2 radicals, forming during the pyrolysis of ammonia during
tobacco combustion, may react with aromatic CH groups (from compounds already
present in the tobacco leaves) to form the AAs (Patrianakos, C., et. al,
1979). In addition to the pyrosynthetic mechanism, AAs may also be transferred
directly from the tobacco leaves into the smoke via thermal degradation of
alkaloids and amino acids (Schmeltz, I., Hoffman, D., 1977; Heckman, R. A.,
Best, F. W., 1981).

In addition to tobacco smoke, other exposure sources of AAs include several
chemical industry sectors such as dyes and pigments (e.g., azo dyes, indigo
dyes), pharmaceuticals, pesticides, herbicides, synthetic rubber and plastics
(IARC, 2000; IARC, 1993; IARC - 4-Aminobiphenly, 2010; IARC - 2-Naphthylanime,
2010; IARC, 1999). In manufacturing these industrial chemicals, AAs are used
as raw materials or intermediates, and therefore, they should not occur in the
final products. As such, occupational exposure to AAs can occur by inhalation
or skin contact during the production of chemicals that use AAs as raw
materials or intermediates. AAs can also be found in environmental pollution
such as diesel exhaust, combustion of wood chips and rubber, and substances in
charcoal barbequed meats and fish (Debruin, L. S., et. al, 1999; Pereira, L.,
et. al, 2015). Natural occurrence of AA was reported, for example, in the
aroma components of black tea, and certain vegetables (Vitzthum, O. G., et.
al, 1975; Neurath, G. B., et. al, 1977). Other potential sources include
emissions from cooking oils (e.g., vegetable, sunflower and refined lard oil)
(Chiang, T. A., et. al, 1999).

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Aromatic amines are quantified by an isotope-dilution gas chromatographic,
tandem mass spectrometric method (ID GC-MS/MS). Urine samples are collected
and stored at approximately -70±10°C. 13C and 2H internal standards are added,
and the samples are hydrolyzed, cleaned up, and extracted on support liquid
extraction (SLE) cartridges.  The analytes are then derivatized to form
pentafluoropropionamides, and analyzed by GC/MS/MS, using multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM). The analyte concentrations are derived from the ratio of the
integrated peaks of native to labeled ions by comparison to a standard curve.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Aromatic Amines Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/AA-AAS-H-
MET-508.pdf) (February 2020)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Aromatic amines were measured in a one-third subsample of persons 6 years and
older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.  

The laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URD1NPLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex. URD1NPLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URX1NP)
provides the analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in pg/mL) for Aromatic Amines in urine is:

**VARIABLE** |  **SAS LABEL** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URX1NP |  1-Aminonaphthalene, urine (pg/mL) |  1.29  
URX2NP |  2-Aminonaphthalene, urine (pg/mL) |  2.79  
URX4BP |  4-Aminobiphenyl, urine (pg/mL) |  1.75  
URXANS |  o-Anisidine, urine (pg/mL) |  7.02  
URXDMN |  2,6-Dimethylaniline, urine (pg/mL) |  15.67  
URXOTD |  o-Toluidine, urine (pg/mL) |  111.22
