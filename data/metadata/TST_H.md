### Sex Steroid Hormone - Serum (TST_H)

####  Data File: TST_H.xpt

##### First Published: November 2018

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

This data will allow for population estimates of the selected steroid hormones
and related binding protein that can be used to assist in disease diagnosis,
treatment, and prevention of diseases such as, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
(PCOS), androgen deficiency, cancer, and hormone imbalances in children. An
estimated 5 to 7 million women in the United States (U.S) suffer with the
effects of PCOS. It is the most common hormonal disorder among women of
reproductive age, which can occur as young as 11 years old, and is the leading
cause of infertility. Androgen deficiency such as hypogonadism is associated
with a range of chronic diseases. The prevalence of symptomatic androgen
deficiency in men between 30 and 79 years of age is estimated to be 5.6%
(Araujo et al, 2007). Androgen deficiency in men and excess in women and the
associated chronic diseases are a public health concern. Estradiol is the key
biomarker for assessing reproductive function in females, including
amenorrhea, infertility, and menopausal status. Estradiol levels decline
greatly with age, and this decrease is associated with increased risk for
cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, and bone fractures in older
populations. Estrogen hormone therapy, or use of estradiol as a supplement,
raises health concerns related to estradiol concentration in blood such as
elevated levels in postmenopausal women increasing the risk of breast cancer.

**Testosterone**

Testosterone is the most important androgenic steroid that has an anabolic
effect in humans. It is synthesized in the testes of the male, and in much
smaller amounts, in the ovary of the female, and in the adrenal gland of both
female and male.  In male humans, testosterone plays a key role in the
development of male reproductive tissues, such as the testis and prostate, as
well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle
and bone mass, and the growth of body hair.  The secretion of testosterone is
regulated by luteinizing hormone (LH), and is subject to negative feedback via
the pituitary and hypothalamus.  Most of the circulating testosterone is bound
to carrier proteins (sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG], and albumin). In
women, increased production of testosterone can cause hirsutism and
virilization (depending on increase).  The determination of testosterone in
the female is helpful in the evaluation of congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
PCOS, and when an ovarian tumor, adrenal tumor, adrenal hyperplasia or ovarian
insufficiency is suspected. Testosterone is determined in men when reduced
testosterone production is suspected, e.g. in hypogonadism, estrogen therapy,
chromosome aberrations (as in the Klinefelter's syndrome) and liver cirrhosis.

**Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)**

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is the blood transport protein for
androgens and estrogens.  SHBG has a high binding affinity to
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), medium affinity to testosterone and estradiol, and
only a low affinity to estrone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstendione,
and estriol. Albumin, which exists in far higher concentrations than SHBG,
also binds sexual steroids - although with a clearly lower binding affinity
(e.g. about 100 times lower for testosterone). Its synthesis and secretion are
regulated by estrogen (Burger, et al. 2002; Davis, et al. 2001). SHBG serum
concentrations depend on the extent, duration, and the kind of estrogen
applied, and how regulation takes place. In the serum SHBG mainly takes over
the transportation of steroids and the reduction/regulation of the effect of
androgen. (Rosner, et al. 1999; Burger, et al. 2002). Decreased SHBG serum
levels are associated with conditions where elevated androgen levels are
present or where the effect of androgen on its target organs is excessive.
This explains the gender-related differences seen between men and women,
especially during puberty.

Measurement of SHBG can be an important indicator of an excessive/chronic
androgenic action where androgen levels are normal, but where clinical
symptoms would seem to indicate androgen in excess. SHBG is a useful
supplementary parameter in the determination of androgen where a relatively
high concentration of free androgen (e.g. testosterone) is suspected (Pugeat,
et al. 1996).

Elevated SHBG levels can be seen in elderly men, and are often found in
patients with hyperthyroidism, cirrhosis of the liver, and some polymorphisms
in the SHBG gene (Bhasin, et al 2018). SHBG levels also increase when oral
contraceptives, estrogen or antiepileptic drugs are taken. Pregnant women have
markedly higher SHBG serum concentrations due to their increased estrogen
production.

Decreased SHBG concentrations are often seen with hypothyroidism, polycystic
ovarian syndrome (PCOS), obesity, hirsutism, elevated androgen levels,
alopecia, acromegaly and some polymorphisms on the SHBG gene.

**Estrogens  **

Estrogens are responsible for the development of the secondary female sex
characteristics. Together with progestogens they control all the important
female reproductive processes. The biologically most active estrogen is 17
ß-estradiol. Estrogens are produced primarily in the ovary (follicle, corpus
luteum), but small quantities are also formed in the testes and in the adrenal
cortex, as well as fat cells. During pregnancy, estrogens are mainly formed in
the placenta. About 98% of estradiol is bound to transport proteins (SHBG and
albumin). Estrogen secretion has two surges during the menstrual cycle. The
determination of estradiol is utilized clinically in the elucidation of
fertility disorders in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis, gynecomastia,
estrogen-producing ovarian and testicular tumors and in hyperplasia of the
adrenal cortex. Further clinical indications are the monitoring of fertility
therapy and determining the time of ovulation within the framework of in vitro
fertilization (IVF).  

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Measurements of total testosterone and estradiol in serum are performed using
isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS)
method for routine analysis developed by CDC. The method was created for high
sample throughput and demonstrates high accuracy and precision over multiple
years. It is certified by CDC Hormone Standardization Program (HoSt) and is
traceable to certified reference materials obtained from Australian National
Measurement Institute, ANMI M914, Australian for testosterone (Zhou, et al,
2017).

SHBG is based on the reaction of SHBG with immuno-antibodies and chemo-
luminescence measurements of the reaction products that occurs after two
incubation periods and subjecting to a magnetic field.  The microparticle are
captured on an electrode, where a chemiluminescent reaction occurs and can be
measured by a photomultiplier tube. The readings are compared to an
instrument- and lot-specific calibration curve.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed description on the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2013-2014 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES Laboratory Data.

**NHANES Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/demo_h.htm) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/fastqx_h.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
ended "LC" (ex., LBATSTLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXTST) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDTSTLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD) for LBXTST, LBXEST and LBXSHBG are:

**Variable Name  ** |  **SAS Label  ** |  **  LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXTST |  Testosterone, total (ng/dL) |  0.75 ng/mL*  
LBXEST |  Estradiol (pg/mL) |  2.994 pg/mL**  
LBXSHBG |  SHBG (nmol/L) |  0.800 nmol/L   
  
        *Multiply by 0.0347 to convert to SI unit nmol/L  

        **Multiply by 3.67 to convert to SI unit pmol/L 

**Testosterone regression equations to compar****e 2013-14 and 2011-12 TST
data:**

A method validation (bridging) study was performed to compare results from a
method change in 2013-2014 cycle for serum total testosterone. Total
testosterone was performed with a HPLC tandem mass spectrometry method that
only measured testosterone (TST) and was switched in mid-2013 to a HPLC tandem
mass spectrometry method that measures TST and estradiol (EST) in the same
analytical run. Randomly selected serum samples (n=139) from NHANES 2013-2014
participants were measured using both methods and the results were used to
conduct the analysis. Data from the bridging study indicated that on average,
testosterone values measured using new method (TST plus EST) were 3.9% higher
than values using old method (TST only) (p<.0001), and the correlation
coefficient (_r_) between the measurements was 0.997.  Regression analysis
were performed using Analyse-It, v4.30.4.  Given that the data showed
proportional differences in variability, a weighted Deming regression was
chosen to adjust the serum testosterone results (ng/mL).  The forward and
backward equations are below:

Forward:         Y (TST plus EST) = 1.021 (95%CI: 1.007 to 1.0354) * X (TST
only) + 0.182 (95%CI: 0.081 to 0.283)

Backward:       Y (TST only) = 0.979 (95%CI: 0.966 to 0.992) * X (TST plus
EST) -0.178 (95%CI: -0.277 to -0.079)

These regression equations should be used when examining trends of
testosterone data across 2013-2014 and 2011-2012 cycles, or when combining the
2013-2014 data with the previous cycle.

As mentioned above, most of the 2013-2014 samples were measured using the TST
plus EST method.  Results in this 2013-2014 dataset from specimens analyzed
using the TST only method were adjusted using the above forward regression
equation.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
