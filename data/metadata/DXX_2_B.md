### Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry - Whole Body, Second Exam (DXX_2_B)

####  Data File: DXX_2_B.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2010

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES 2001-2002 Second Day Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry Exam was
conducted for quality assurance and research purposes in the NHANES mobile
examination center (MEC) in 2000 through 2002. The procedures for the second
day exam were the same as those for the primary exam and can be found in the
Body Composition Procedures Manual located on the NHANES website. **Second day
DXA data for 2000 can be accessed only through the National Center for Health
Statistics Research Data Center.**

No statistical sampling was applied for selection of second day exam
participants; the sample was self-selected and nonrandom. For the second day
exam, the MEC staff recruited participants aged 16-69 years, approximating
percentages in demographic categories for the primary exam. Participants were
given the option to decline the second exam. In general, about 11% of those
who completed the first exam also completed the second exam. Seven hundred
fifty (750) participants completed the second day DXA exam.

Participants were asked to come for the second day exam at least 8 days after
their first exam. The second day exams were conducted during the same time
period as the primary exams for a particular survey stand or location. The
same radiology technologist who conducted the second day exam was not always
the same as the technologist who conducted the first exam. Participants were
remunerated for the second day exam.

**Missing and invalid DXA data from the second day exam were not multiply
imputed as were data from the primary exam. The second day DXA data file
(DXX_2_B) contains only 1 record for each survey participant.** Users of the
second day DXA data (DXX_2_B) are encouraged to read this documentation before
accessing the data file.

The second day DXA scans provide bone and soft tissue measurements for the
total body, for both arms and both legs, the trunk, and head. Bone
measurements also were obtained for the pelvis, left and right ribs, thoracic
spine, and lumbar spine. Values for the total body and regions include:

  * Total mass (gm)Â 
  * Bone mineral content (BMC) (gm)Â 
  * Bone area (cm2)Â 
  * Bone mineral density (BMD) (gm/cm2)Â 
  * Fat mass (gm)Â 
  * Lean mass excluding BMC (gm)Â 
  * Lean mass including BMC (gm)Â 
  * Percent body fat (%) 

The second day exam data file also contains variables on the number of days
between the primary and second day exams and whether the same technologist
conducted both primary and second day exams or whether different technologists
conducted the two exams.

## Eligible Sample

The second day DXA scans were administered to eligible survey participants
aged 16-69 years in 2000-2002 who had completed the primary exam. Participants
excluded from the primary DXA examination for reasons other than pregnancy,
such as self-reported history of radiographic contrast material (barium) use
in past 7 days, weight over 300 pounds, or height over 6â5 (limitations of
the DXA table), were considered to be eligible nonrespondents. Pregnant
females were not eligible for the DXA exam.

DXAEXSTS â examination status variable  
1 = Scan completed  
2 = Scan completed, but invalid

## Protocol and Procedure

Whole body DXA scans were taken with a Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer
(Hologic, Inc., Bedford, Massachusetts). Hologic software version 8.26:a3* was
used to administer all scans. The densitometer scanned participants with an
x-ray source using fan-beam scan geometry in three passes (1 minute per pass).
The participants were positioned supine on the tabletop with their feet in a
neutral position and hands flat by their side. A Velcro strap was used to keep
the feet stationary and together. The DXA examinations were administered by
certified radiology technologists. Further details of the DXA examination
protocol are documented in the Body Composition Procedures Manual located on
the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

A high level of quality control was maintained throughout the DXA data
collection and scan analysis, including a rigorous phantom scanning schedule.

**Monitoring of Field Staff and Densitometers  
**Staff from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the NHANES
data collection contractor monitored technologist acquisition performance
through in-person observations in the field. Retraining sessions were
conducted with the technologists annually and as needed to reinforce correct
techniques and appropriate protocol. In addition, technologist performance
codes were recorded by the NHANES quality control center at the University of
California, San Francisco (UCSF), Department of Radiology as part of the
participants' scan review. The codes documented when the technologist had
deviated from acquisition procedures and scan quality could have been
improved. The performance codes were tracked for each technologist
individually and a summary reported to NCHS on a quarterly basis. Constant
communication was maintained throughout the year among the UCSF, the NCHS, and
the data collection contractor regarding any issues that arose.

Hologic service engineers performed all routine densitometer maintenance and
repairs. Copies of all reports completed by the manufacturer's service
engineers were sent to the UCSF when the scanners were serviced or repaired so
any changes in measurement as a result of the work could be assessed. While
some minor mechanical repairs were made during 2001-2002 survey operations,
replacement or realignment of the detectors, apertures, or other major
hardware was not required for any of the three densitometers.

**Scan Analysis**  
Each participant scan was reviewed and analyzed by the UCSF using standard
radiologic techniques and study-specific protocols developed for the NHANES.
Hologic Discovery software, version 12.1, was used to analyze the scans.
Expert review was conducted by the UCSF on 100% of analyzed participant scans
to verify the accuracy and consistency of the results. Invalidity codes were
applied by the UCSF to regions of the body that could not be analyzed
accurately. The invalidity codes are provided in the data file (see Analytic
Notes for a description of the invalidity codes).

The percentage of eligible survey participants in 2001-2002 with 100% valid
data (no invalid regions) decreased with increasing age. The decrease in valid
data with age was due primarily to an increase in the number of participants
with implants such as pacemakers, stents, and hip replacements and higher
rates of obesity resulting in excessive x-ray "noise" due to truncal
adiposity, which interfered with the ability to obtain valid measurements. The
percentage of participants with 100% valid data also decreased with increasing
BMI due to truncal adiposity. **For these reasons, as well as the exclusion of
participants over 300 pounds from the DXA exam, users should be aware that the
second day DXA data are not representative of all survey participants. Users
should also be aware that regions of the body that may have been invalid in
the primary exam may be valid in the second-day exam and vice versa.** For
example, jewelry may not have been removed or a positioning problem may have
occurred in one scan and not the other.

**Quality Control Scans**  
The quality control phantoms were scanned according to a predetermined
schedule. The Hologic Anthropomorphic Spine Phantom associated with each MEC
was scanned daily as required by the manufacturer to ensure accurate
calibration of the densitometer. Other MEC-specific phantoms, such as the
Hologic Whole Body Slim-line Phantom and Hologic Tissue Step Phantom, were
scanned 1 to 3 times weekly. Another set of phantoms, the Hologic Spine
(HSP-Q96), Hologic Block, and Hologic Whole Body Phantoms, circulated among
the MECs and were scanned at the start of operations at each survey site.

Air scans, phantom-less scans using the whole body scan mode, were used to
describe and monitor the systems' radiographic uniformity across the entire
scan field. The complete phantom scanning schedule is described in the Body
Composition Procedures Manual located on the NHANES website.

The UCSF used the Cumulative Statistics method (CUSUM) and the MEC-specific
phantom data to determine breaks in the calibration of the densitometers over
the course of the survey (Lu, 1996). Multiplicative correction factors were
used to correct the phantom data back to the baseline calibration. The type,
frequency, and magnitude of calibration problems detected in the NHANES data
were similar to those in other studies using stationary densitometers that
were being monitored by UCSF. The correction factors were judged to be small
and adjustment of the participant data not required.

## Data Processing and Editing

The NHANES lean soft tissue mass and fat mass for the total body and regions
were adjusted based on the results of an analysis of QDR- 4500A DXA data from
seven research laboratories indicating that the QDR-4500A algorithm
underestimated fat mass and overestimated lean mass (Schoeller, 2005). Based
on criterion measurements of body composition from total body water by
dilution, underwater weighing, and four-compartment analysis, the QDR-4500A
was determined to overestimate lean mass (p < 0.05) in the cohort of 1198
subjects. The NHANES DXA lean mass was decreased by 5% and an equivalent
kilogram weight added to the fat mass so the total mass did not change.

No other adjustments were made to the second day DXA data.

## Analytic Notes

Because the second day sample was self-selected and nonrandom, no survey
sample weights are associated with the second day DXA data. NCHS recommends
that survey design variables such as sample weight not be linked with the
second exam data, since these variables were created for use with the primary
sample. The second day DXA data were intended to be used only for quality
control and research purposes such as assessing intra-individual variability.  
  
The second day exam data can be linked to the primary exam data and household
interview data using the unique participant identifier (SEQN). Caution should
be used in the analysis of the second day exam data. Analyses should include
an investigation of the potential selection bias of the second day exam sample
and evaluation of differences in characteristics such as age, gender, and
race/ethnicity between the first and second day exam samples.  
  
Because the second day exam data were not multiply imputed, the numbers and
types of variables included in the second day exam data file will differ from
those in the data file for the first exam. The variable nomenclature also
differs: the first exam variable names have an X or D in the third position,
while the second day exam variables have a 2 in the third position. For
example, DXXTOPF becomes DX2TOPF.  
  
**Invalidity Codes**  
Invalidity codes were applied only to completed and valid scans (DXAEXSTS=1).
Codes 1-7 indicate the reasons regions could not be analyzed accurately.  
  
Invalidity codes  
DXADISP = entire scan  
DXATOBCC = total bone mineral density  
DXATOPFC = total percent body fat  
DXASTBCC = subtotal (excludes head) bone mineral density  
DXASTPFC = subtotal (excludes head) percent body fat  
DXAHEBV = head bone  
DXAHETV = head soft tissue  
DXALABV = left arm bone  
DXALATV = left arm soft tissue  
DXALLBV = left leg bone  
DXALLTV = left leg soft tissue  
DXARABV = right arm bone  
DXARATV = right arm soft tissue  
DXARLBV = right leg bone  
DXARLTV = right leg soft tissue  
DXATRBV = trunk bone, includes invalid thoracic or lumbar spine, left or right
ribs, or pelvis  
DXATRTV = trunk soft tissue  
  
Values for invalidity codes  
1 = Jewelry and other objects not removed  
2 = Non-removable objects (includes prostheses, implants, casts)  
3 = Excessive x-ray ânoiseâ due to truncal adiposity, i.e., the DXA  
Â Â Â Â Â beam could not penetrate the layers of abdominal fat to provide an  
Â Â Â Â Â analyzable scan image (applied to the trunk region only)  
4 = Arm/leg overlap  
5 = Body parts out of scan region  
6 = Positioning problem (head, arms/hands or feet turned)  
7 = Other (includes participant motion, unknown artifacts, deformities)
