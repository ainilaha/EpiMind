## Component Description

**See the general documentation of Second Day Laboratory Exams.** Also, see
the documentation for the primary exam data for Lab 11 C-Reactive Protein

**C-reactive protein (CRP)**

C-reactive protein is considered one of the best measures of the acute phase
response to an infectious disease or other cause of tissue damage and
inflammation. It is used to correct the iron status measures, which are
affected by inflammation. It can also be used to measure the bodyâs response
to inflammation from chronic conditions, such as arthritis, and environmental
exposures to agents such as tobacco smoke.

**Fibrinogen (FB)**

Fibrinogen is an essential blood-clotting factor and is involved in a range of
other functions, including platelet aggregation and smooth muscle
proliferation. A growing body of evidence has identified fibrinogen as an
important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the major cause of death in
the U.S. The objective of including this measure was to provide data on
laboratory, clinical, and socio-demographic correlates of fibrinogen levels.
Of particular importance in NHANES, the data can be used to study the
relationship between fibrinogen levels and clinically measured lower extremity
arterial blood flow as assessed by the Ankle-Brachial Index in the Lower
Extremity Disease component.

**Bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP) and Urinary N-telopeptides (NTx)**

Evaluation of bone mineral status can utilize measures of total bone mineral
content and bone mineral density. Serum bone alkaline phosphatase is a marker
of bone formation and urinary N-telopeptides are markers of bone resorption.

## Eligible Sample

C-reactive protein (CRP) Participants aged 16-69 years were tested.

Fibrinogen Participants aged 40-69 years were tested.

Bone alkaline phosphatase Participants aged 16-69 years were tested.

N-telopeptides Participants aged 16-69 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**C-reactive proteinÂ**

This method quantified C-reactive protein (CRP) by latex-enhanced
nephelometry. Particle-enhanced assays were based on the reaction between a
soluble analyte and the corresponding antigen or antibody bound to polystyrene
particles. For the quantification of CRP, particles consisting of a
polystyrene core and a hydrophilic shell were used in order to link anti-CRP
antibodies covalently. A dilute solution of test sample was mixed with latex
particles coated with mouse monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. CRP present in the
test sample forms an antigen-antibody complex with the latex particles.

An automatic blank subtraction was performed. CRP concentrations were
calculated by using a calibration curve. Data reduction of the signals was
performed by using a storable logit-log function for the calibration curve
performed data reduction of the signals. These assays were performed on a
Behring Nephelometer for quantitative CRP determination.

**Fibrinogen**

On the STA-Compact, the Clauss clotting method determined the fibrinogen
concentration in plasma quantitatively. This test method involves measuring
the rate of fibrinogen to fibrin conversion in diluted sample under the
influence of excess thrombin. Since under these conditions the fibrinogen
content was rate limiting, the clotting time can be used as a measure of the
concentration of the fibrinogen and in fact, the clotting time is inversely
proportional to the level of fibrinogen in the plasma.

Clot detection by the STA-Compact involved an electromagnetic- mechanical
system. The oscillation of a steel ball within the cuvette with the thrombin
and diluted plasma was monitored by the STA-Compact. When the oscillation of
the steel ball was stopped by clot formation, the sensor registered the time
in seconds. The time was translated into fibrinogen concentration from a
fibrinogen standard curve, stored on the STA Compact.

**Bone alkaline phosphatase**

There were two methods used to measure Bone Alkaline Phosphatase in NHANES
2001-2002.

For NHANES 2001, the HybritechTandem-MP Ostase ImmunoEnzymetric assay was used
for quantitative measurement of Bone Alkaline Phosphatase (BAP), an indicator
of osteoblastic activity, in human serum.

The Hybritech Ostase assay was a solid phase, monoclonal antibody
immnumoenzymetric assay. Samples containing BAP were reacted with a biotin-
labeled, BAP-specific monoclonal antibody. The reaction was performed in a
plastic well strip (solid phase) coated with strepavidin and enclosed in a
plastic frame. Following the formation of a solid phase/capture antibody/BAP
complex, the microplate was washed to remove unbound BAP and was then
incubated with an enzyme substrate. The amount of substrate turnover was
determined colorimetrically by measuring the absorbance of the quenched
reaction at 405 nm in a microplate reader. The absorbance was proportional to
the concentration of BAP present in the test sample. The calculation of BAP
concentration in the sample was based on concurrent testing of BAP calibrators
and the Zero Diluent/calibrator.

For NHANES 2002, the Beckman Access Ostase assay was used to measure serum
Bone Alkaline Phosphatase. The Access Ostase assay is a one-step
immunoenzymatic assay. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific to BAP is added to
a reaction vessel with paramagnetic particles coated with goat anti-mouse
polyclonal antibody. Calibrators, controls and samples containing BAP are
added to the coated particles, and bind to the anti-BAP monoclonal antibody.
Following the formation of a solid phase/capture antibody/BAP complex,
separation in magnetic and washing remove materials not bound to the solid
phase. A chemiluminescent substrate, Lumi-Phos*530, is added to the reaction
vessel and light generated by the reaction is measured with a luminometer. The
light production is directly proportional to the concentration of BAP in the
sample. The amount of analyte in the sample is determined from a stored,
multi-point calibration curve.

**Urinary N-telopeptides**

There were two methods used to measure Urinary N-telopeptides in NHANES
2001-2002.

In NHANES 2001, the Osteomark assay was used and is a competitive inhibition
enzyme linked solid-phase immunosorbent assay for the quantitative measurement
of the cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I bone collagen (Ntx) in human
urine. The solid phase consists of microwells onto which cross-linked
telopeptides (antigen) are adsorbed. Urine controls, test samples and
calibrators were added to the antigen coated 96 well plates. Antibody to the
N-telopeptide cross-links that are conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was
then added to each well. During an initial incubation period, antigen in the
sample competed with the solid phase antigen for binding to the antibody. The
wells were then washed to remove unbound material.

Buffered substrate/chromogen reagent was then added to each well. During the
final incubation, a blue color can develop when bound antibody-horseradish
peroxidase conjugate was present in the well. The color intensity was a
measure of the amount of conjugated antibody bound to the solid phase antigen,
and was inversely proportional to the amount of antigen in the test sample.
The reaction was stopped by the addition of stopping reagent (1N sulfuric
acid) which results in a color change from blue to yellow. The absorbance
values for the control, calibrators and test samples were determined
spectrophotometrically at 450 nm with a 650 nm reference filter, by using a
microtiter plate reader.

In NHANES 2002, N-telopeptides was measured using the Vitros Eci instrument.
The Vitros NTx assay is a competitive immunoassay technique using a synthetic
NTx peptide which has been coated on the reaction wells provided in the
reagent pack. This assay depends on competition between this synthetic peptide
and the NTx present in the specimen being tested.

These two sources of peptide compete for binding with a horse radish
peroxidase (HRP) -labeled antibody conjugate (mouse monoclonal anti-NTx). The
conjugate is captured by the peptide coated on the wells. Any unbound
materials are removed through a washing step. The bound HRP conjugate is then
measured through the addition of a luminescent substrate. This signal reagent
contains the luminogenic substrates (a luminol derivative and a peracid salt)
and an electron transfer agent. The HRP in the bound conjugate catalyzes the
oxidation of the luminol derivative. This produces a light signal. The
electron transfer agent (a substituted acetanilide) increases the level of the
light and prolongs its emission. This light signal is read by the Vitros. The
level of HRP conjugate bound is indirectly proportional to the concentration
of NTx present.

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood and urine specimens are processed, stored and shipped to University of
Washington, Seattle, Washington. Detailed specimen collection and processing
instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists
Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data processing and
editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in theÂ Description of
Laboratory Methodology section

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.  
  

## Analytic Notes

**Adjustment of Bone Alkaline Phosphatase was necessary for NHANES 2001 data
because of a change of laboratory methods between 2001 (using the Hybritech
method) and 2002 (using the Beckman Access method).** The distributions of
sample person results were compared between NHANES 2001 and NHANES 2002 and
the BAP test had significantly (p < 0.05) different means. A cross-over study
between the two methods was performed to establish regression equations to
convert NHANES 2001 values to NHANES 2002 values. The regression equations
were applied to the BAP test, and a t-test was done after regression that
showed no significant differences of BAP test means between the two methods
after regression. The regression equations were derived from a spline
technique using logarithm-transformed BAP values. The following regression
equation was obtained:

**x = log(lbxbap);  
lb2bap = exp(-0.5326 + 1.1139*x - 0.7963*(max(0, x-4.5151)) +
0.9660*(max(0,x-4.9030)));**

where lbxbap is the BAP (ug/L) value from the 1999-2001 Hybritech method and
lb2bap is the BAP (ug/L) equivalent value for the 2002-2004 Beckman Access
method. The analyst may wish to use this equation to trend the 1999-2004 BAP
data.

**Adjustment of Urinary N-telopeptides was necessary for NHANES 2001-2002 data
because of a change of laboratory methodsÂ from 2001 (Osteomark) to 2002
(Vitros).** The distributions of sample person results were compared between
NHANES 2001 and NHANES 2002 and the NTX was higher in 2001 when compared to
2002. A cross-over study between the two methods was performed to establish
regression equations to convert NHANES 2002 values to NHANES 2001 equivalent
values. The regressions were validated for NTX values up to 4000 nM. Many
children (8-19 years) had values above 4000 nM, but only one adult (20+ years)
had a value greater than 4000 nM. Data for adults (20+ years) was released and
data for 8-19 years is available in the Research Data Center at the National
Center for Health Statistics.

**The second day exam data was a convenience sample and thus did not have
sample weights.** The analysis of NHANES 2001-2002 laboratory data must be
conducted with the key survey design and basic demographic variables. The
NHANES 2001-2002 Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data,
health indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain sample weights for these age groups. The
phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may be linked
to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier
SEQN.
