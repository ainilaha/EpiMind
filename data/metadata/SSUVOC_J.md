### Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Metabolites II - Urine (Surplus)
(SSUVOC_J)

####  Data File: SSUVOC_J.xpt

##### First Published: September 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Human exposure to benzene, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural is associated
with numerous health risks, including potential or known carcinogenicity
(benzene [Smith, 2010], 5-hydroxymethylfurfural [Abraham et. al., 2011]),
respiratory toxicity (benzene [Bahadar et. al., 2014], furfural [NIOSH,
2019]), neurotoxicity, and birth defects (benzene [Bahadar et. al., 2014]).
Human exposure may occur via multiple routes from various sources, including
tobacco smoke (Smith, 2010; Talhout et al. 2006), e-cigarette aerosol (Soussy
et. al., 2016; Behar et. al., 2018; Pankow et. al., 2017), automobile exhaust
(Smith, 2010), industrial applications (Smith, 2010; Machado et. al., 2016),
and food products (Abraham et. al., 2011; Piggott, 2003; Hodge, 1953). Due to
the potential adverse health effects of these VOCs and the U.S. population's
exposure to them, improving the exposure assessment of these compounds in the
general US population and/or in specific population groups is of public health
significance.

VOCs can be metabolized prior to urinary excretion, so VOC exposure can be
assessed by measuring their urine metabolites. An analytical method was
developed to measure metabolites of benzene (_trans_ ,_trans_ -Muconic acid
[SSMUCA]; N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine [SSPHMA]), furfural (N-2-Furoylglycine
[SSN2FG]), and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid
[SSHMFA]; 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furoylglycine [SSHMFG]), which will greatly
improve our understanding of the extent of exposure to these selected VOCs.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure to measure urinary metabolites of
benzene, furfural, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using ultra-performance liquid
chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry
(UPLC-ESI-MS/MS). Sample preparation involves 1:10 dilution of 50 µL urine
samples in ammonium formate buffer, pH 2.9. Chromatographic separation of each
prepared urine specimen is achieved by using a Waters Acquity UPLC HSS fluoro-
phenyl (PFP) column using a mobile phase _A_ (0.02% formic acid) and a mobile
phase _B_ (methanol). The eluate from the column is ionized using electrospray
ionization, which is used to generate and transmit ions into the mass
spectrometer. Comparison of relative response factors (ratio of native analyte
to stable isotope-labeled internal standard) with known standard
concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations in each sample
(Bhandari et. al., 2019).

The VOC Metabolites II dataset was produced by applying an improved method for
measuring N-Acetyl-S-phenyl-L-cysteine (PHMA). NHANES cycle 2015-2016 and
prior measured PHMA (NHANES variable URXPMA, dataset UVOC_I) in urine samples
at neutral pH. Conversely, NHANES cycle 2017-2018 measured PHMA (NHANES
variable SSPHMA) in urine samples prepared at pH 2.9. This acid treatment
converts the PHMA precursor, i.e., pre-PHMA to PHMA; thus the new method
quantifies both free PHMA and PHMA formed from the acid dehydration of pre-
PHMA (Bhandari et. al., 2019). This new PHMA measure more accurately assesses
benzene exposure (Sterz et. al., 2010). The PHMA results reported in NHANES
2017-2018 (SSPHMA) should not be directly compared with PHMA (URXPMA) reported
in previous NHANES analyses (Tevis et. al., 2020).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the 2017-2018 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Urinary metabolites of Benzene, Furfural, 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural, and
N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone Laboratory Procedure Manual
(2017-2018)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/SSUVOC-
J-MET-508.pdf) (September 2022)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the 2017-2018 NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the CDC and contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include
performing blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. Additionally, availability of specimens for surplus projects
is lower than for other laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The
specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for details on
the use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample, WTSSAJ2Y, are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data. The sample
weights created for this file used the examination sample weight, i.e.,
WTMEC2YR, as the base weight. The base weight was adjusted for additional
nonresponse to these lab tests and re-poststratified to the population total
using sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Participants who were part of the eligible
population but who did not provide a urine specimen, or did not have
sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their
specimens to be used for future research are included in the file but they
have a sample weight assigned "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
"Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**  
  
The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "L" (ex., SSPHMAL) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
SSPHMAL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., SSPHMA) provides the
analytic result for the analyte. All data are rounded to three significant
figures or three decimal places, whichever is less precise.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for SSHMFA, SSHMFG, SSMUCA,
SSN2FG, and SSPHMA:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Name** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
SSHMFA |  5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic acid (ng/mL) |  36.1  
SSHMFG |  5-Hydroxymethyl-2-furoylglycine (ng/mL) |  16.0  
SSMUCA |  _trans, trans_ -Muconic acid (ng/mL) |  9.81  
SSN2FG |  N-2-Furoylglycine (ng/mL) |  64.4  
SSPHMA |  Phenylmercapturic acid (ng/mL) |  0.150
