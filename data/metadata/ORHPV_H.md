### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) - Oral Rinse (ORHPV_H)

####  Data File: ORHPV_H.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2016

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The human papillomavirus (HPV) in oral rinse estimates the prevalence and
determinants of oral HPV infection in the United States population. Oral HPV
infection is newly appreciated as a strong risk factor for a distinct type of
oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma that is rising in incidences in the
United States. It has been estimated that oral HPV16 infection confers an
approximate 15-fold increase in risk for oropharyngeal cancer. Despite these
strong risks, little is known about the epidemiology of oral HPV infection. No
population-based surveys of oral HPV infection, type distribution and
determinants, have been performed in any population worldwide.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants, aged 14-69 years, were tested. The public-use data file
includes data for persons 18-69 years of age. Please see _Analytic Notes
_about the release of data for adolescents 14-17 years of age.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Samples will be centrifuged at 4,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4°C; the pellet
will be resuspended in 1 ml of Puregene cell lysis solution and incubated at
37°C for 15 min followed by DNase-free RNase a (5µg/ml) digestion for 30 min
at 37°C. Proteinase K (20 mg/ml) digestion will be performed overnight at 55°C
followed by heat inactivation for 10 min at 95°C. Protein precipitation
solution (340 µL) will be added and sample will be further purified according
to the Puregene DNA purification kit protocol.

Purified DNA will be analyzed for 37 types of HPV by means of a multiplex
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay targeted to the conserved L1 region of
the viral genome, using PGYM09/11 primer pools and primers for ß-globin (33).
PCR products will be denatured in 0.13 N NaOH and hybridized to an immobilized
HPV probe array (Roche Diagnostics) using an extended line-blot assay for
genotyping of 37 HPV types, including HPV-6, -11, -16, -18, -26, -31, -33,
-35, -39, -40, -42, -45, -51, -52, -53, -54, -55, -56, -57, -58, -59, -61,
-62, -64, -66, -67, -68, -69, -70, -71, -72, -73, -81, -82 (MM4 and IS39
subtypes), -83, -84 and -89, and ß-globin (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.,
Alameda, CA). Positive controls, consisting of 10 and 100 HPV-16 (SiHa) or
HPV-18 (C4-2)-positive cells diluted in a background of HPV-negative cells
(K562), and a negative control (K562 cells), in addition to the manufacturer's
controls, are included in each experiment. Samples positive for ß-globin will
be considered of sufficient quality for analysis. The HPV type will be
reported for positive samples.

Refer to NHANES 2013-2014 Lab Methods for HPV in oral rinse for detailed
description of the laboratory method used.

There were no changes to equipment, lab method, or lab site for this component
for the 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Human Pappillomavirus - Oral
Rinse](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/ORHPV_H_OHPV_R_MET.pdf)
(October 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Oral rinse specimens were processed, stored and shipped to the Ohio State
University Gillison Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Ohio State University for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013 - 2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES 2013 - 2014 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013 - 2014
Demographics File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/demo_h.htm)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/fastqx_h.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The public release data file includes Oral HPV data for participants aged
18-69\. Data for youth aged 14-17 years are available through the [NCHS
Research Data Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

**Detection Limits**

Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower LLODs isn't
applicable.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
