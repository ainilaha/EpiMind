# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2003-2004 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Oral Health - Periodontal/Lower (OHXPRL_C)

####  Data File: OHXPRL_C.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2006

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

NHANES is critical for monitoring oral health status, risk indicators for
disease, and access to preventive and treatment services. This component will
address public health significance in areas of surveillance, prevention,
treatment, dental care utilization, health policy, evaluation of Federal
health programs, standardization of new methods, and oral health disparities.

Oral health data from NHANES will be used for:

  * Assessing the prevalence of major oral health diseases and conditions including dental caries, periodontal disease, dental trauma, dry mouth, and dental fluorosis 
  * Assessing prevention and treatment efforts including the prevalence of dental sealants 
  * Evaluating specific public health programs/new policies and initiatives 
  * Monitoring the oral health status of minority/underserved populations 
  * Evaluating Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives related to oral health 
  * Supporting research activities as identified in the 2000 Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health in the United States.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 2 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria are eligible. A positive response to any of the following medical
health-screening questions asked of participants aged 13 years or older will
exclude them from the periodontal and root caries assessments. Participants
aged 13-15 years must have a health proxy signed by a parent/guardian to
participate in the oral health examination.

  * Has a doctor or dentist ever told you that you must always take antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) before you get a dental check up or care? 
  * Do you have a heart problem (specifically congenital heart murmurs, heart valve problems, congenital heart disease, or bacterial endocarditis)? 
  * Do you have rheumatic fever? 
  * Kidney disease requiring renal dialysis? 
  * Hemophilia? 
  * Pacemaker or automatic defibrillator or artificial material in your heart veins or arteries?

## Protocol and Procedure

The following subcomponents are from the oral health examination component and
home interview component with the age groups of interest in parentheses:

Examination:

  * Medical history screening (13 years and older) 
  * Dental sealant assessment (2 to 34 years of age) 
  * Tooth count (2 years and older) 
  * Coronal caries (2 years and older) 
  * Incisor traumatic injuries (10 to 29 years of age) 
  * Dental fluorosis assessment (6 to 49 years of age) 
  * Periodontal pockets, recession, loss of attachment, and bleeding (13 years and older) 
  * Root caries (18 years and older) 
  * Dental erosion and tooth wear (13 years and older) 
  * Functional occlusal contacts (25 years and older) 
  * Self-assessed dental condition questions (16 years and older) 
  * Denture use and wear questions (25 years and older) 
  * Recommendations for dental care (2 years and older) 

Interview:

  * Dry mouth and problems with chewing food (18 years and older) 
  * Dental health perception, dental visits and dental care utilization (2 years and older) 
  * Oral health quality of life (16 years and older) 
  * Perceived dental treatment needs (18 years and older) 

**Survey Staff and Protocol**

The oral health exam is performed by trained dentists who hold a state dental
license in an US jurisdiction. One of up to seven trained oral health
recorders is paired with a dentist to form a dental examination team. Two
teams function independently throughout the data collection period. All oral
health exam data is collected in the mobile examination center. Oral health
data obtained during the home interview is collected by trained interviewers.
Interview and examination protocols are discussed in detail in the NHANES Oral
Health Home Interview and Exam Training Manuals. These manuals are available
at the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The quality of data in this survey is controlled by

  1. an intense training period for the dental teams with calibration of dental examiners prior to the beginning of the survey, 
  2. periodic monitoring and recalibration of dental examiners, and 
  3. periodic retraining of dental teams. 

The reference examiner will visit each team three times per year to observe
field operations and to replicate 20 to 25 dental examinations during each
visit. The purpose of these "expert replications" is to determine if the field
examiners are maintaining the examination standards achieved during training
and to measure the degree of deviation, if any, from those standards. If the
inter-rater correlation is not within acceptable limits, retraining is
conducted on site and future monitoring of the field examiner intensified. An
annual retraining session for each dental examiner also is conducted by the
reference examiner to reinforce existing protocols and to accommodate protocol
updates as needed.

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES
1999. In the mobile examination centers (MECs), data for the oral health
component are recorded directly onto a computerized data collection form. The
system is integrated centrally and it allows for ongoing monitoring of much of
the data. As part of an on-going quality control practice, all data are
reviewed systematically for logical inconsistencies and examiner error.
Internal quality control data review indicates that data quality is
acceptable.

## Analytic Notes

The oral health data is released in the configuration of six "chapters." The
oral health chapters and subcomponents in parentheses are matched as follows:

  * Dentition Exam (ohxden_): Tooth count, coronal caries, root caries, dental sealants, incisor trauma, and dental fluorosis. 
  * Dentition-Addendum Exam (ohxadd_): Tooth wear and functional occlusal contacts. 
  * Periodontal Exam-Upper (ohxpru_): Maxillary periodontal pockets, recession, loss of attachment, and bleeding. 
  * Periodontal Exam-Lower (ohxprl_): Mandibular periodontal pockets, recession, loss of attachment, and bleeding. 
  * Miscellaneous (ohxref_): Medical exclusions, denture questions, care recommendations, and miscellaneous. 
  * Home Interview (ohq_): Dry Mouth, dental visits, quality of life dental health perception and perceived treatment needs. 

A variety of oral health variables can be derived to assist analysts using the
oral health exam data. Recommended derivations and a selection of sample code
for dental caries status, dental fluorosis, dental sealants, and periodontal
status is provided at the Oral Health Data Resource Center (DRC):
<http://drc.nidcr.nih.gov/>. Additional information regarding the NHANES
datasets, including quality assurance publications and prevalence reports
supported by the federal partners is also available at the DRC.

It is recommended that data users merge relevant 2003-2004 oral health data
files with 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 oral health data files to ensure adequate
sample size for analyses of many of the oral health outcome measures available
in these files. The six-year sample weights can be calculated by data users.
Additional analytical details are available at:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx>.

**Special Notes**

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 oral health data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. Other household questionnaire and oral questionnaire
files may be linked to the oral health examination data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN. The Oral Health Exam (OHX) and Oral Health
Questionnaire (OHQ) data are publicly available at the NHANES website.

New content was added to the 2003-2004 Oral Health Exam and Interview making
the NHANES Oral Health Component one of the most comprehensive assessments of
oral health in the United States to date. Consequently, many variables are
only available for the 2003-2004 survey period, which may significantly impact
some data analyses.
