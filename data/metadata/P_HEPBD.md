## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic infection with
these viruses, information about the prevalence of these diseases is needed to
monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally representative sample of
the U.S. population, NHANES will provide the most reliable estimates of age-
specific prevalence needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies to
prevent these infections. In addition, NHANES provides the means to better
define the epidemiology of other hepatitis viruses. NHANES testing for markers
of infection with hepatitis viruses is used to determine secular trends in
infection rates across most age and racial/ethnic groups and will provide a
national picture of the epidemiologic determinants of these infections.

Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver most often caused by a virus. Viral
hepatitis is a major public health problem of global importance because of the
ongoing transmission of viruses that cause the disease and increased morbidity
and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of these
infections. Global and US goals have been established for elimination of viral
hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 (HHS Healthy People, 2022 and HHS
2020).

In the US, the most common types of viral hepatitis are hepatitis A, B, and C.
Effective vaccines are available to help prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis B.
No vaccine is available for hepatitis C; however, highly effective, well-
tolerated treatment can cure hepatitis C virus infection. Hepatitis D virus
infection is less common in the US and can occur only among persons with
hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis E infection also is less common in the
US. These five hepatitis viruses, also called hepatitides, are well-
characterized for detection with laboratory assays and are monitored in U.S.
public health surveillance systems.

NHANES viral hepatitis data are used to monitor progress toward goals in
_Healthy People_ and the HHS _Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan_ , which
in turn support US and global viral hepatitis elimination goals (HHS Healthy
People, 2022 and NASEC, 2017). The viral hepatitis laboratory and interview
components of NHANES complement data from outbreak, case-based surveillance,
vital statistics, health care systems, and cohort studies that can provide
timely, detailed, or longitudinal information for subnational geographic areas
and disproportionately affected populations, such as persons experiencing
homelessness or living in correctional facilities; however, these sources lack
information available from NHANES, such as race, ethnicity, education, income,
and health status and behaviors.

Viral hepatitis data from NHANES are available beginning with the Second
NHANES conducted during 1976-1980 for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and with
the Third NHANES conducted during 1988-1994 for hepatitis C, hepatitis D and
hepatitis E.

An estimated 300 million people worldwide are persistent carriers of hepatitis
B virus (HBV). Infection with HBV results in a wide spectrum of acute and
chronic liver diseases that may lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular
carcinoma. Co-infection with hepatitis D virus (HDV) in persons with acute or
chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection can lead to fulminant hepatitis.

Transmission of HBV occurs by percutaneous exposure to blood products and
contaminated instruments, sexual contact and perinatally from HBV-infected
mothers to their unborn child.

HBV infection produces an array of unique antigens and antibody responses
that, in general, follow distinct serological patterns.

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), derived from the viral envelope, is the
first antigen to appear following infection and can be detected serologically
as an aid in the laboratory diagnosis of acute HBV infection.

Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is detectable shortly after the
appearance of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). As the appearance of anti-
HBsAg may be delayed after HBsAg clearance, anti-HBc is sometimes the only
serological marker for HBV infection and potentially infectious blood. Anti-
HBc is found in acute and chronic hepatitis B patients and also indicates past
resolved infection.

The Delta antigen/antibody system (HDAg/Anti-HDV) is related to HBV infection
but immunologically distinct from its known reactivities; it is the expression
of the Delta virus (Hepatitis D Virus, HDV), a cause of severe liver disease
in HBsAg carriers. HDV is a 35-37nm particle containing low molecular weight
RNA and HDAg, with an outer coat of HBsAg obtained from HBV. HDV is a
defective virus and its replication requires helper functions provided by HBV.
HDAg has been detected in liver and in serum and induces a specific antibody
response (anti-HDV antibodies) in both the IgG and IgM classes.

Tests for anti-HBc, HBsAg, and anti-HDV are conducted as part of the NHANES
viral hepatitis component.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years or older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc)**

Hepatitis B core antibody is measured using the VITROS Anti-HBc assay, which
is performed using the VITROS Anti-HBc Reagent Pack and VITROS
Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-HBc Calibrator on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ or VITROS
3600 Immunodiagnostic System.

The hepatitis B core antibody test is performed on all examined participants
aged 6 years and older while the hepatitis B surface antibody test is
performed on all examined participants aged 2 years old and older (reported in
[P_HEPB_S](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_HEPB_S.htm)).

**Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)**

Hepatitis B surface antigen is measured using the VITROS HBsAg test, which is
performed using the VITROS HBsAg Reagent Pack and VITROS Immunodiagnostic
Products HBsAg Calibrator on the VITROS ECi/ECiQ Immunodiagnostic Systems and
the VITROS 3600 Immunodiagnostic System.

The Hepatitis B surface antigen is tested only when the Hepatitis B core
antibody test is positive or indeterminate.

**Hepatitis D antibody (anti-HDV)  
**  
Hepatitis D antibody was measured using the DiaSorin ETI-AB-DELTAK-2 assay
during 2017-2018 and the Anti-HDV IgG WES Assay during January 2019 through
March 2020.

The Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is a RNA defective virus; and an infection
with HDV only occurs in the presence of acute or chronic HBV infection. In
NHANES, the test for antibody to HDV is performed on all examined participants
6 years and older who test positive or indeterminate for anti-HBc and HBsAg.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals
(LPMs). Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until
they were shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for
HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
Laboratory Data Overview for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020 approximately 76%
of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017 - March
2020Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

This data is qualitative. The use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

**Hepatitis D Antibody (Delta) Method Change**

The method for Hepatitis D Antibody (delta) changed between survey cycles
2017-2018 and 2019-2020. The commercial kit (Diasorin) used during the
2017-2018 survey cycle was discontinued by the manufacturer. The Diasorin test
had a sensitivity of 100% (86.7-100) and a specificity of 100% (91.9-100),
however, these sensitivity and specificity were not independently verified due
to a lack of well characterized sample evaluation panel. A CDC laboratory
developed test was used in 2019-2020 survey cycle and had a sensitivity of 96%
and a specificity of 97%. The sensitivity and specificity for this newly
developed method are verified using a convenience sample of NHANES specimens
and non-NHANES specimens tested previously using the commercially available
kit.
