### Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 & Type-2 (HSV_H)

####  Data File: HSV_H.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2015

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

HSV-2 infection is one of the best markers of sexual risk factors leading to
sexually transmitted infections, because: (a) HSV-2 infections are common and,
thus, HSV-2 rates are a measure of sexual risk in the broader population
beyond high risk groups; (b) HSV-2 infection is almost always a result of
sexual transmission and, thus, a specific measure of sexually transmitted
infection; (c) HSV-2 infections are not curable and, thus, HSV-2 risk is not
influenced by health care-seeking factors; and (d) sensitive, specific, and
relatively inexpensive tests for HSV-2 antibody are available. HSV-2 is a very
important marker for monitoring the impact of large national efforts,
motivated by the HIV epidemic, to reduce risky sexual behaviors.

NHANES laboratory data can be linked to NHANES sexual behavior ACASI questions
to assist in the understanding of national trends in HIV and sexually
transmitted diseases. The availability of sexually transmitted infection and
risk factors data in a national sample over time is a unique and invaluable
resource for evaluation of national HIV/STD risk-reduction efforts and for
risk-based modeling of the burden and trends of sexually transmitted
infections.

**Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1)**

Sera from NHANES participants aged 14-49 were tested for antibody to herpes
simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). HSV-1 is a common chronic infection that is the
cause of most oral herpes or cold sores.

**Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 (HSV-2)**

Sera from NHANES participants aged 14-49 were tested for antibody to herpes
simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-2 is a sexually transmitted infection and
can be used as a marker for sexual transmission of other infectious agents.
HSV-2 infections are rarely life threatening, but morbidity due to painful
genital ulcerations is significant.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 14-49 years were eligible. HSV-2 data for youth
adolescents aged 14-17 years are available through the Research Data Center
(RDC).

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Although extensive antigenic cross-reactivity exists between the two viral
types of herpes, a viral glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex virus type 2
(HSV-2) (designated gG-2) and a glycoprotein specific for herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) (designated gG-1) have been identified. Monoclonal antibodies
and affinity chromatography have been used to purify these glycoproteins and
thus provide antigens for type-specific herpes serologic assays. Solid-phase
enzymatic immunodot assays are used to detect antibodies reactive to these
antigens. The purified glycoprotein, gG-1 or gG-2, is adsorbed to the center
of a nitrocellulose disk. The rest of the disk surface is coated with bovine
serum albumin to prevent further nonspecific protein adsorption. Incubation of
test serum with the disk allows specific antibodies, if present, to bind to
the immobilized antigen. After extensive washing to remove non-reactive
antibodies, the bound antibodies are detected by sequential treatment with
peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-human IgG and the enzyme substrate (H2O2 with
chromogen 4-chloro-1-naphthol). A positive reaction is demonstrated by the
appearance of a blue dot at the center of the disk. Serum reactive to an
immunodot charged with gG-1 indicates the person being tested has HSV-1
infection. Serum reactive to an immunodot charged with gG-2 indicates the
person being tested has HSV-2 infection.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 and Type-2
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/HSV_H_MET_HERPES_1_2.pdf)
(October 2015)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to Emory University,
Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Emory University for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet Emory's quality control and quality assurance
performance criteria for accuracy and precision.  


## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/demo_h.htm) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/fastqx_h.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The items LBXHE1 and LBXHE2 represent type-specific enzymatic immunodot assay
results. The type-specific immunodot assays used to detect antibodies reactive
to HSV-1 & HSV-2 antigens in NHANES 2013-2014 are the same assays as those
used in NHANES 1999-2012 and NHANES III. Therefore, HSV-1 and HSV-2 results
from these surveys are identical and comparable for trend analyses.

The public release data file includes HSV-1 data for participants aged 14-49
and HSV-2 data for participants aged 18-49\. HSV-2 data for youth aged 14-17
years are available through the [NCHS Research Data Center
(RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

**Detection Limits**

Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower limits of
detection (LLODs) isn't applicable.Exam sample weights should be used for
analyses. Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
