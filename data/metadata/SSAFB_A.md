### Aflatoxin B1-lysine - Serum (Surplus) (SSAFB_A)

####  Data File: SSAFB_A.xpt

##### First Published: August 2012

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at

## Component Description

Measurement of concentrations (ng/mL) of aflatoxin B1-lysine, derived from
aflatoxin B1-albumin adducts, in a 2,104 serum sample subset of NHANES
1999-2000.

## Eligible Sample

A one-third subset of examined participants ≥ 12 years of age from NHANES
1999-2000.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

** _Measurement of serum aflatoxin-albumin adducts_**

Modification of the method of McCoy et al. (2005) was used to assess
aflatoxin-albumin adducts in serum. NHANES serum specimens were obtained from
McKesson Plasma and Biologics (San Francisco, CA) where they were stored at
-70°C; specimens were residual sera that were previously freeze/thawed one or
more times. In brief, the laboratory used a high throughput method in which
250µL serum was robotically aliquoted into 96-well plates and spiked with
100µL of tetradeuterated internal standard (aflatoxin B1-lysine-d4) to account
for recovery. Aflatoxin B1 adducts were hydrolyzed from serum albumin using
enzymatic digestion with pronase which was incubated in a 40°C water bath for
4 hours or overnight at 37°C. Once digestion was complete, samples were
transferred to an automated solid phase extraction (SPE) system.

The method employed a mixed-mode anion exchange sorbent in an automated SPE of
AFB1-lysine (AFB-lys) resulting from the enzymatic hydrolysis of serum
albumin. SPE columns were eluted with 2% formic acid in methanol. An isotope
dilution mass spectrometry based method (LC-MS/MS triple quadrupole MS using
electrospray ionization) was used for routine quantitation of AFB-lys as a
measure of individual exposure to aflatoxin B1.

Concentrated samples were injected onto a C18 HPLC chromatographic column and
eluted with a gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.06% formic acid to
resolve the AFB-lys from other matrix constituents. Analytes were detected
using positive ionization selective reaction monitoring mode and quantified
using 4-point linear calibration curves that used 1/x2 weighting; quantitation
was based on peak area ratios using the internal standard to correct for
recovery. Peak area ratios (aflatoxin B1-lysine m/z: aflatoxin B1-lysine-d4
m/z) were linearly related to concentration. Instrument voltages and
temperatures were optimized to yield optimum intensity of AFB-lys, as
previously published. AFB-lys concentrations were quantitated in a subset of
NHANES 1999-2000 serum specimens in 62 separate assays.

Transitions for aflatoxin B1-lysine (AFB-lys) and deuterated internal standard Analyte | Q1 (Da) | Q3 (Da)  
---|---|---  
Aflatoxin B1-lysine | 457.3 | 394.2  
Aflatoxin B1-lysine-d4 | 461.3 | 398.3  
  
The average (±SD) calibration slope for assays containing NHANES samples was
1.1±0.2 and average intercept was 0.0047±0.016. Calibration curves had an
average (±SD) r2 of 0.999±0.008. Calibrators were required to be within 15% of
their nominal values for all assays in which results above the lower limit of
detection were reported. Two different calibration ranges were used; the lower
range was used in the majority of the NHANES analyses.

Four calibration standards (ng/mL) used in 62 assays to measure serum concentrations of aflatoxin B1-lysine (AFB-lys) in NHANES 1999-2000 No. Assays | Calibrator 1 | Calibrator 2 | Calibrator 3 | Calibrator 4  
---|---|---|---|---  
6 | 0.07 | 0.34 | 0.68 | 2.73  
56 | 0.01 | 0.05 | 0.5 | 1.5  
  
Blanks were analyzed concurrently with unknown samples and were used to
determine if any analyte contamination had occurred. Blanks contained 250µL
25% methanol in place of serum; one blank was included in each assay. In none
of the 62 assays containing NHANES samples, was AFB-lys detectable in the
blank.

Relative retention times were used to select the correct peaks for integration
and quantitation. AFB-lys eluted 0.02±0.01 min after the internal standard in
the QC pools which were known to contain aflatoxin B1-albumin adducts and
similarly, 0.02±0.02 min after the internal standard in the unknown NHANES
samples. Peaks greater than 0.06 minutes from the internal standard were not
considered to be representing AFB-lys.

**_Limit of Detection (LOD)_**

Using a combination of approaches, the lower limit of detection (LOD) was
determined to be 0.02 ng/mL. Results near the LOD are subject to greater
uncertainty. Several schemes were used to estimate the LOD including 1) Taylor
series to estimate the SD of a zero sample via extrapolation of a linear
dilution series to zero concentration, 2) visual evaluation of chromatography
around the LOD, and 3) estimation of the LOD by calculating 3 times the s0
where s0 is the standard deviation of the concentration of a near-background
sample that was measured multiple times.

Summary of activities to estimate the lower limit of detection (LOD) for AFB-lys in serum using a LC-MS/MS assay Date of Analysis | LOD Scheme | Design | Estimate of LOD (ng/mL)  
---|---|---|---  
Aug-06 | Taylor series (3*SD of a zero sample) | 5 dilutions, singlicates per dilution over 3 days (15 points) | 0.018  
Feb-07 | Taylor series (3*SD of a zero sample) | 3 dilutions, 5 replicates per dilution over 3 days (45 points); also evaluated chromatography for appropriateness | 0.018  
Jan-08 | Chromatographic evaluation | Evaluated 7 chromatograms at about 0.02, 0.48, 1.5 ng/mL for appropriateness of 0.02 ng/mL | 0.02  
Aug-10 | 3*SD of a sample close to zero | Nearly zero sample, singlicate over 3 days (3 points) | 0.04  
Feb-12 | Chromatographic evaluation | Evaluated 27 chromatograms =LOD from NHANES and dozens  | 0.02  
  
**_Standard stability_**

A concentrated stock standard solution stored at -70°C was diluted to an
intermediate concentration that was further diluted and used to prepare
individual calibrators. The highly concentrated stock material, synthetic AFB-
lys, was purified using semipreparative HPLC-UV. Stability of this stock
solution over the course of 7 years was periodically determined. Degradation
was no more than 2%. Calibrators were adjusted accordingly after each
determination.

Stability of the concentrated stock of AFB-lys stored at -70°C Date of analysis | [AFB-lys] µg/mL  
---|---  
Jul-04 | 4.23  
Oct-07 | 4.19  
Jun-11 | 4.17  
  
To test for stability of the intermediate stock standard solutions that were
diluted from the concentrated stock, we stored materials at -20°C or -70°C for
up to 2 years. We demonstrated complete stability at -70°C.

Stability of the intermediate stocks of AFB-lys stored at -20°C or -70°C Initial[AFB-lys] ng/mL | Storage temperature | Storage time | Stability  
---|---|---|---  
50 | -20°C | 3 mo | 90%  
4 | -70°C | 2 yr | 100%  
  
**_Serum stability_**

To test for stability of aflatoxin-albumin adducts in serum, high (HS04501)
and low (LS04500) bench QC pools were stored at variable temperatures and
times; AFB-lys concentrations were compared to concentrations in pools that
were continuously stored at -70°C for 3.3 years. Pools stored at -20°C or 4°C
for 1.6 years, or 37°C for 0.25 years showed no evidence of degradation. QC
serum maintained at room temperature for 16 h prior to sample processing for
quantitative analysis showed no evidence of degradation.

QC pools were also submitted to three freeze/thaw cycles and subsequently
analyzed within a single analytical run. On average, there appeared to be a
small decrease in the AFB-lys concentrations (average 97±2% of expected
result) over the course of three cycles but all concentrations from freeze-
thaw samples were within QC limits thus indicating no significant decrease
could be established.

From the literature, Scholl and Groopman reported that using two closely
comparable chromatographic methods (LC-MS/MS and HPLC-fluorescence), a set of
19 serum specimens with AFB-lys concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 6 ng/mL
stored for 15 years at -80°C, gave AFB-lys results that were essentially
unchanged; currently, this appears to be the longest term demonstration of
aflatoxin-albumin adduct stability in serum.

**_Reproducibility_**

Approximately 75 percent of the NHANES samples (1,572/2,104) were tested once
for AFB-lys. Considering all NHANES samples, of those with AFB-lys results
greater than or equal to the LOD (27/2,104), 93 percent (25/27 cases) were
measured more than once to attempt to confirm the finding; only those with
insufficient serum were not retested (2/27 cases). Because most positive
results were around the LOD and because of the inherent variability of results
around the LOD (>30% CVanalytical), we expected inconsistency in repeating and
confirming results. Confirmation was considered achieved if a subsequent
result was ≥LOD. We defined AFB-lys-positive samples having at least one
result that conformed to the relative retention time requirement for AFB-lys
peak selection (see earlier). Thus, not all AFB-lys-positive results were
confirmed, however, all of the highest results (>0.05 ng/mL) were repeated and
confirmed (see following table).

Repeat analysis of 27 AFB-lys-positive samples grouped by concentration at or grouped above the LOD (0.02 ng/mL) [AFB-lys] ng/mL | N | ≥LOD Confirmed  
---|---|---  
0.02 | 7 | 1/7 (14%)  
0.03 - 0.05 | 15 | 8/15 (53%)  
0.06 - 0.20 | 5 | 5/5 (100%)  
  
## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The laboratory and method were certified according to the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (1988) guidelines.

Units of serum were obtained from Tennessee Blood Services (Memphis, TN) and
were screened using the methodology described above; all units of serum that
were screened exhibited undetectable AFB-lys. All quality control pools were
prepared by spiking human serum with serum from rats that were dosed with
aflatoxin B1 to create aflatoxin B1-albumin adducts. Targeted concentrations
of AFB-lys were estimated and confirmed before dispensing the blended serum
pools into 2-mL cryovials for storage at -70°C.

Before each analytical run, individual calibration standards, bench QC
materials and serum samples were thawed from -70°C to room temperature.
Calibrators and QC materials were prepared and analyzed in parallel with the
NHANES samples.

Typical assays consisted of 4 calibration samples, 1 blank, 3 bench quality
control samples, 53 subject person's serum followed by 3 bench quality control
samples. One in every 20 subject person's serum in the assay was a random
blind QC pool.

**_Blind Quality Control_**

Three blind QC pools were used during the analysis of the survey specimens.
Their results were required to be within 3 standard deviations of the
characterization means. At the end of the study, summary statistics were
tabulated for the blind QC pools that were included in the 62 assays from this
study.

The following two tables show the mean, standard deviation of individual
results (SDi) and analytical coefficient of variation (CVa) for aflatoxin
B1-lysine concentrations (ng/mL) from individual blind quality control pools
during the characterization period and during the period of analysis of NHANES
samples

Blind quality control pools during the characterization period Blind QC Pools | Mean | SDi | CVa  
---|---|---|---  
High | 4.22 | 0.34 | 8%  
Medium | 1.55 | 0.12 | 8%  
Low | 0.49 | 0.06 | 11%  
Blind quality control pools during NHANES Analysis Blind QC Pools | Mean | SDi | CVa  
---|---|---|---  
High | 4.22 | 0.35 | 8%  
Medium | 1.53 | 0.01 | 9%  
Low | 0.48 | 0.04 | 9%  
  
**_Bench Quality Control_**

Five bench QC pools, prepared as described above, were characterized to
determine the quality control limits for duplicate samples. After
establishment of the control limits of the pools, QC samples contained within
each analytical run were evaluated for validity by use of a multi-rule quality
control SAS program. Each analytical run contained 2-3 pools in duplicate.

The following two tables show the mean, standard deviation of pair mean (SDm)
and analytical coefficient of variation (CVa) for aflatoxin B1-lysine
concentrations (ng/mL) in bench quality control pools during characterization
period and during the period of analysis of NHANES samples

**_External Quality Assurance_**

As an external quality assurance activity, a sample exchange was conducted to
assess the comparability of three different methods for measuring serum AFB-
lys concentrations. Published results showed that isotope dilution LC-MS/MS
was the most sensitive technique and HPLC-fluorescence was the least sensitive
method. Overall, this exchange showed excellent correlations among the three
independent methodologies, including ELISA, which were conducted in different
laboratories. The two chromatographic methods showed satisfactory agreement
(LC-MS/MS = HPLC-fluorescence ÷ 0.71). In summary, the results supported the
validation of these technologies for assessment of human exposure to this
environmental toxin and carcinogen.
