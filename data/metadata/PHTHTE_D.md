### Phthalates - Urine (PHTHTE_D)

####  Data File: PHTHTE_D.xpt

#####  First Published: February 2010

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Phthalate acid esters (phthalates) have been used extensively as plasticizers
in a wide range of applications such as children's toys, food packaging,
personal care products, and medical supplies. Because some of these compounds
have been shown to bind to estrogen receptors and have been associated with
estrogenic effects in laboratory animals, increasing concerns have been
expressed about phthalate usage in food packaging materials, personal care
products, and children's toys. Measurement of urinary phthalate metabolites in
humans is useful to evaluate recent exposure and potential human health
effects from these chemicals.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The test principle utilizes high performance liquid chromatography-
electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for the
quantitative detection in urine of the following phthalate metabolites:
monomethyl phthalate (mMP), monoethyl phthalate (mEP), monobutyl phthalate
(mBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (miBP), mono (3-carboxypropyl) phthalate
(mCPP), monocyclohexyl phthalate (mCHP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (mEHP),
monooctyl phthalate (mOP), monobenzyl phthalate (mBzP), monoisononyl phthalate
(mNP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (mEOHP),
mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (mEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl)
phthalate (mECPP), monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP), and monocarboxynonyl
phthalate (MCNP)Â (Kato et al., 2005; Silva et al., 2007) Urine samples are
processed using enzymatic deconjugation of the glucuronidated phthalate
monoesters followed by on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with
reversed phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS.Â Assay precision is improved by incorporating
isotopically-labeled internal standards of the phthalate metabolites. In
addition, 4-methyl umbelliferone glucuronide is used to monitor deconjugation
efficiency.Â This selective method allows for rapid detection of monoester
metabolites of commonly used phthalate diesters in human urine with limits of
detection in the low ng/mL range.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. Â

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (â20Â°C) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained. Â

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM. Â

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens. Â

NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS and Westat. Summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, are
reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern. Â

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciencesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).Â Â

## Analytic Notes

Mono-ethyl phthalate (URXMEP), Mono-benzyl phthalate (URXMZP), Mono-n-octyl
phthalate (URXMOP), Mono-isononyl phthalate (URXMNP), and Mono-cyclohexyl
phthalate (URXMCP):  
NHANES recently learned that analytical standards used since 1999 and used for
several metabolites were of insufficient purity. As a result of further
investigation, a correction factor was applied to each value for the 5
metabolites.

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary environmentals were measured in a one third subsample of
persons 6 years and over.  Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.  

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables.  The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.  

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.  

**Detection Limits**  

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes.  The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection.  There
are two values: "0" and "1"".  "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection.   "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection.  In cases, where the result was below the limit of detection, the
value for that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of
two.  

The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.  

The lower limit of detections for the environmental phthalates are
