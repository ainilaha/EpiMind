### Organophosphate Insecticides - Diakyl Phosphate Metabolites - Urine
(L26OPD_C)

####  Data File: L26OPD_C.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2009

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Organophosphorus insecticides, which are active against a broad spectrum of
insects, have accounted for a large share of all insecticides used in the
United States. Although organophosphorus insecticides are still used for
insect control on many food crops, most residential uses have been phased out
in the United States as a result of implementation of the Food Quality
Protection Act of 1996. Pesticide residues and their metabolites in human
tissues and fluids can be indicative of pesticide exposure and the total body
burden of these pesticides. About 75% of registered organophosphorus
insecticides are metabolized in the body to measurable dialkyl phosphate (DAP)
metabolites. Dialkyl phosphates may also occur in the environment as a result
of degradation of organophosphorus insecticides, and therefore, the presence
in a person's urine may reflect exposure to the metabolite itself.

Generally, six urinary dialkyl phosphate metabolites of organophosphorus
insecticides have been measured: dimethylphosphate (DMP);
dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP); dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP);
diethylphosphate (DEP); diethylthiophosphate (DETP); and
diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP). Each of the six urinary dialkyl phosphate
metabolites can be produced from the metabolism of more than one
organophosphorus insecticide or may be present following ingestion of the
specific DAP metabolite. Therefore, the presence of one or more dialkyl
phosphate metabolites without additional information cannot be linked to
exposure to a specific organophosphorus insecticide.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method was developed for quantifying the six DAP urinary metabolites of
at least 28 organophosphorus pesticides using lyophilization and chemical
derivatization followed by analysis using isotope-dilution gas chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Urine samples were spiked with stable
isotope analogues of the DAPs and the water was removed from the samples using
a lyophilizer. The dried residue was dissolved in acetonitrile and diethyl
ether, and the DAPs were chemically derivatized to their respective
chloropropyl phosphate esters. The chloropropyl phosphate esters were
concentrated, and analyzed using GC-MS/MS. The limits of detection of the
method were in the low mg/l (parts per billion) to mid pg/ml range (parts per
trillion) with coefficients of variation of 7-14%. The use of stable isotope
analogues as internal standards for each of these metabolites allows for
sample-specific adjustment for recovery and thus permits a high degree of
accuracy and precision. Use of this method with approximately 1100 urine
samples collected from pregnant women and children indicate that the low
limits of detection allow this method to be used in general population
studies.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.  
Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind split
samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract laboratories
randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Any problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS and Westat. Summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, are
reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary diakyl phosphate metabolites were measured in a one third
subsample of persons 6 years and over. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes except for
diethyldithiophosphate (URXOP6) in the data set. Diethyldithiophosphate
(URXOP6) has two detection limits. Two variables are provided for each of
these analytes. The variable named URD___LC indicates whether the result was
below the limit of detection. There are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means
that the result was at or above the limit of detection. "1" indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection.

The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The detection limit divided by the square root of 2 is the value that is
provided for results that are below the limit of detection.

The lower limit of detections for the diakyl phosphate metabolites is:

Lower Limit of Detections for the Diakyl Phosphate Metabolites Analyte | Item ID  | Limit of Detection (LLOD)  
---|---|---  
Dimethylphosphate | URXOP1 | 0.5  
Diethylphosphate | URXOP2 | 0.1  
Dimethylthiophosphate | URXOP3 | 0.5  
Diethylthiophosphate | URXOP4 | 0.2  
Dimethyldithiophosphate | URXOP5 | 0.1  
Diethyldithiophosphate | URXOP6 | 0.1  
  
Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
