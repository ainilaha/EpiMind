# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2003-2004 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Complete Blood Count with 5-part Differential - Whole Blood (L25_C)

####  Data File: L25_C.xpt

#####  First Published: January 2006

#####  Last Revised: August 2007

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are to:

  1. Provide data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 
  2. Evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status; and 
  3. Evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies - including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs - on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. 

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to Whole Blood levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further
define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention
and health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 1 year and over were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The methods used to derive CBC parameters are based on the Beckman Coulter
method of counting and sizing, in combination with an automatic diluting and
mixing device for sample processing, and a single beam photometer for
hemoglobinometry. The WBC differential uses VCS technology. See Chapter 7 of
the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM) for
details.

The Beckman Coulter MAXM instrument in the Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)
produces a complete blood count on blood specimens and provides a distribution
of blood cells for all participants.

There were no changes to the equipment, lab methods, or lab site from the
previous 2 years.

A detailed description of the laboratory method used can be found on the
NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood specimens were measured at the NHANES MECs. Detailed specimen collection
and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM. Read the LABDOC
file for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical
methods are described in the Description of the Laboratory Methodology
section.

This file contains no top coding.

Five derived variables were created in this data file. The formula for their
derivation is as follows:

LBDLYMNO = LBXWBCSI * LBXLYPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDMONO = LBXWBCSI * LBXMOPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDNENO = LBXWBCSI * LBXNEPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDEONO = LBXWBCSI * LBXEOPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)  
LBDBANO = LBXWBCSI * LBXBAPCT/100 (round to 1 decimal)

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found on
the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such
as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and
phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.
