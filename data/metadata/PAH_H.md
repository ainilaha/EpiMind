### Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) - Urine (PAH_H)

####  Data File: PAH_H.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2016

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**

PAHs constitute a group of chemicals formed during the incomplete combustion
of coal, oil and gas, garbage, and other organic substances. In general,
people are exposed to mixtures of PAHs, and the sources are widespread,
including vehicle exhaust, asphalt, coal tar, wild fires, agricultural
burning, charbroiled foods, and tobacco smoke. Upon entering the body, PAHs
are readily metabolized and eliminated in urine. Urinary concentrations of PAH
metabolites, specifically monohydroxylated PAHs (OH-PAHs), have been used as
biomarkers of human exposure to select PAHs including naphthalene, fluorene,
phenanthrene, and pyrene.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The specific analytes measured in this method are monohydroxylated metabolites
of PAHs (OH-PAHs), namely 1-hydroxynaphthalene, 2-hydroxynaphthalene,
2-hydroxyfluorene, 3-hydroxyfluorene, 1-hydroxyphenanthrene, 2- &
3-hydroxyphenanthrene, and 1-hydroxypyrene. The analytical procedure involves
enzymatic hydrolysis of glucuronidated/sulfated OH-PAH metabolites in urine,
extraction by on-line solid phase extraction, and separation and
quantification using isotope dilution high performance liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (on-line SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) (Wang et al., 2016).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed description of the
laboratory procedure manual of the method used.

In previous cycles, the method used for the quantification of OH-PAHs was
based on derivatization and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
Starting with the current NHANES cycle, we used a different approach that
relies on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Note that with the
on-line SPE-HPLC-MS/MS approach, the combined levels of 2- &
3-hydroxyphenanthrene in NHANES 2013-2014 are comparable to the sum of urinary
levels of 2-hydroxyphenanthrene and 3-hydroxyphenanthrene reported as two
separate variables in previous NHANES cycles. There were no changes to the lab
site for this component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are stored frozen (-20°C)
until they are shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for
testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary OH-PAHs were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6 years and
older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic ([Demographic
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013))
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDP04LC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: The value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDP04LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXP04)
provides the analytic result for the analyte.

**Lower Limit of Detection (LLOD, in ng/L) for Urinary OH-PAHs** Variable Name | SAS Label | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URXP01 | 1-Hydroxynapthalene (1-Naphthol) | 60  
URXP02 | 2-Hydroxynapthalene (2-Naphthol) | 90  
URXP03 | 3-Hydroxyfluorene | 8  
URXP04 | 2-Hydroxyfluorene | 8  
URXP06 | 1-Hydroxyphenanthrene | 9  
URXP10 | 1-Hydroxypyrene | 70  
URXP25 | 2-Hydroxyphenanthrene & 3-Hydroxyphenanthrene | 10  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/nhanes/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

* URXP25 values are comparable to the sum of urinary levels of 2-hydroxyphenanthrene and 3-hydroxyphenanthrene reported as two separate variables (URXP07 and URXP05, respectively) in previous NHANES cycles.
