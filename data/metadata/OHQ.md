# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 1999-2000 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Oral Health (OHQ)

####  Data File: OHQ.xpt

##### First Published: January 2004

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

NHANES is critical for monitoring oral health status, risk indicators for
disease, and access to preventive and treatment services. This component will
address public health significance in areas of surveillance, prevention,
treatment, dental care utilization, health policy, evaluation of Federal
health programs, standardization of new methods, and oral health disparities.

Oral health data from NHANES will be used for:

  * Assessing the prevalence of major oral health diseases and conditions including dental caries, periodontal disease, dental trauma, dry mouth, and fluorosis 
  * Assessing prevention and treatment efforts including the prevalence of dental sealants 
  * Evaluating specific public health programs/new policies and initiatives 
  * Monitoring the oral health status of minority/underserved populations 
  * Evaluating Healthy People 2000 and 2010 objectives related to oral health 
  * Supporting research activities as identified in the 2000 Surgeon Generalâs Report on _Oral Health in the United States_

## Eligible Sample

**Eligible Sample Inclusion Criteria**

Participants aged 2 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria

**Exclusion Criteria**

A positive response to any of the following medical health screening questions
asked of participants aged 13 years or older will exclude them from the
periodontal and root caries assessments. Participants aged 13 to 15 years must
have a health proxy signed by a parent/guardian to participate in the oral
health examination.

  * Has a doctor or dentist ever told you that you must always take antibiotics (e.g. penicillin) before you get a dental check up or care? 
  * Do you have a heart problem (specifically congenital heart murmurs, heart valve problems, congenital heart disease, or bacterial endocarditis)? 
  * Do you have rheumatic fever? 
  * Kidney disease requiring renal dialysis? 
  * Hemophilia? 
  * Pacemaker or automatic defibrillator or artificial material in your heart veins or arteries? 
  * A hipbone or joint replacement?Â 

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

**Data Collection Methods**

For oral health data collected in the mobile examination center, detailed
information and instructions are discussed in the NHANES 2000 Oral Health
Training Manual. For oral health data collected during the home interview,
detailed information and instructions are described in the NHANES 2000 Home
Interview Training Manual.

**Examination and Interview Protocol**

The following subcomponents are from the oral health examination component and
home interview component with the age groups of interest in parentheses:

  * Medical history screening (13 years and older) 
  * Dental sealant assessment (2 to 34 years of age) 
  * Tooth count (2 years and older) 
  * Coronal caries (2 years and older) 
  * Incisor traumatic injuries (10 to 29 years of age) 
  * Dental fluorosis assessment (6 to 49 years of age) 
  * Periodontal pockets, recession, loss of attachment, and gingival bleeding (18 years and older) 
  * Root caries (18 years and older) 
  * Recommendations for dental care (2 years and older) 
  * Dry mouth and problems with chewing food (40 years and older) 
  * Dental health perception, dental visits and dental care utilization (2 years and older) 

**Survey Staff**

One of up to seven trained oral health recorders is paired with a licensed
dentist to form a dental examination team. Two teams function independently
throughout the data collection period. During the home interview, oral health
data are collected by trained interviewers.

**Data Collection Forms**

Detailed placement and reading instructions are discussed in the NHANES Oral
Health Training and Home Interview Training Manuals. Each chapter specifies
procedures to be used for each of the oral health subcomponents.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The quality of data in this survey is controlled by

  1. an intense training period for the dental teams with calibration of dental examiners prior to the beginning of the survey,
  2. periodic monitoring and recalibration of dental examiners, and
  3. periodic retraining of dental teams. 

The gold standard examiner will visit each team three times per year to
observe field operations and to replicate 20 to 25 dental examinations during
each visit. The purpose of these "expert replications" is to determine if the
field examiners are maintaining the examination standards achieved during
training, and to measure the degree of deviation, if any, from those
standards. If the inter-rater correlation is not within acceptable limits,
retraining will be conducted on site and future monitoring of the field
examiner intensified. Approximately 10% of examined participants are asked to
return for a replicate exam. The purpose of these "repeat exams" is to monitor
internal consistency within examiners regarding the data collection process.
There will be an annual retraining session for each dental examiner, also
conducted by the gold standard examiner.

## Data Processing and Editing

Automated data collection procedures for the survey were introduced in NHANES
1999. In the mobile examination centers (MECs), data for the oral health
component are recorded directly onto a computerized data collection form. The
system is centrally integrated and it allows for ongoing monitoring of much of
the data.

## Analytic Notes

The oral health exam data will be released in the configuration of four
"chapters." These chapters are: Dentition, Periodontal, Miscellaneous, and the
Home Interview chapter. The oral health chapters and subcomponents in
parentheses are matched as follows:

  * Dentition (Tooth count, coronal caries, root caries, dental sealants, incisor trauma, and Fluorosis) 
  * Periodontal (Periodontal pockets, recession, loss of attachment, and gingival bleeding) 
  * Miscellaneous (Medical exclusions, care recommendations, and miscellaneous) 
  * Home Interview (Dry Mouth, dental visits, dental health perception) 

**Special Notes on Using the Dataset**

The analysis of NHANES 1999-2000 oral health data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 1999-2000
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. Other household questionnaire and oral questionnaire
files may be linked to the oral health examination data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.

Circumstantial factors have produced reasonable doubt as to the examined
validity of assessing some anterior teeth for caries experience and incisor
trauma. Consequently, a very few observations (3) have had the affected
variables set to missing. Moreover, two dental sealant observations were
change to a "9" (can not assess) during data preparation for public release
because of inconsistency in the recorded data field.

The 1999-2000 dental examiner procedural manual lists a "C" as an acceptable
call by the examiner for a crowned tooth, but "C' is not an allowable value.
"C" was immediately converted to an acceptable surface code for restorations
(e.g., "5689" for anterior teeth and "56789" for posterior teeth) by the
direct data automated entry system at the time of data collection. Thus, a "C"
is not listed as a possible code in the codebook. The examiner manual does
refer to "C" as a "short call" for allowable restored surface codes.

NHANES 1999-2000 collected tooth-specific data on enamel fluorosis (EF) using
Dean's Index, developed by H.T. Dean in the 1930s and 1940s. The examiner
determines which of six ordinal categories (normal, questionable, very mild,
mild, moderate and severe) best describes each tooth and assigns a
corresponding score of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively. A tooth is scored
as questionable (0.5) if:

The enamel discloses slight aberrations from the translucency of normal
enamel, ranging from a few white flecks to occasional white spots. This
classification is used in those instances where a definite diagnosis of the
mildest form of fluorosis is not warranted and a classification of "normal" is
not justified. (Burt and Eklund. 1999. Dentistry, Dental Practice and the
Community, 5th Edition.) Included in this category are teeth that show no more
than 1-2 mm of white opacity at the cusp tips of posterior teeth or incisal
edges of anterior teeth.

If a person level score is to be determined, it should be based on the two
teeth most affected by fluorosis. If the two teeth are not equally affected,
the classification given is that of the less severely involved tooth.
Following Dean's definition, a person would have a whole-mouth Dean's Index
score of 0.5 (questionable) if two or more teeth have questionable signs and
there are not two or more teeth with higher EF severity. This working
definition of questionable allows many possible clinical presentations
depending on the number of teeth with questionable signs of EF (from 2-28). In
addition, Dean's definition allows a person with one tooth having very mild or
higher EF to be classified as having questionable enamel fluorosis, if that
tooth is the only tooth with higher than questionable clinical signs. When
Dean's data for populations exposed to 0.9 and 1.2 ppm F in the drinking water
are plotted, a dose-response is observed from "No" EF (highest proportion) to
"Severe" EF (smallest proportion). In estimating prevalence, Dean did not
include children with "questionable" EF.

In the NHANES 1999-2000 data, the distribution of EF severity appears bimodal,
with peaks at "Normal" EF and "Very Mild" EF. It appears that examiners often
assigned codes of either "Normal" or "Very Mild" EF, rather than use the
"Questionable" category. It should be kept in mind that examiners assigned
codes to individual teeth and not to the person; therefore, it is plausible
that the bimodal presentation may reflect a shift in the application of Dean's
diagnostic criteria. At this time, staffs of the Division of Oral Health
(DOH), CDC, and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research
(NIDCR), in coordination with NCHS, are analyzing these data. Point estimators
as well as potential limitations of these data will be published during 2004.
Furthermore, the future release of NHANES data for 2001-2002 will allow
further analysis of these issues.

Although the current NHANES was designed to produce a nationally
representative sample for each 2-year data collection interval, the sampling
frame was designed to produce reliable estimates using 6-years of data for
analyses using lower prevalent conditions. For some low prevalent conditions,
which may also have geographical variation (such as EF produced by natural
fluoride levels in the drinking water), reliable and precise analyses may not
be possible with only two years of data.

For these reasons, the interpretation of age-specific estimates of EF
prevalence and severity (in the lowest categories) using the 1999-2000 dataset
should be made with caution. Comparisons with the previous national survey of
enamel fluorosis (National Institute of Dental Research, 1986-1987) should
take into account, in addition to the information noted here, the different
protocols and sampling designs. Researchers are encouraged to review the
descriptive documentation for each of these surveys before reaching
epidemiological conclusions regarding possible trends.
