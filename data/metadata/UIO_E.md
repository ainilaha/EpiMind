### Iodine - Urine (UIO_E)

####  Data File: UIO_E.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2009

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Iodine, an essential element for thyroid function, is necessary for normal
growth, development, and functioning of the brain and body. Iodine-deficiency
disorder (IDD) is a well documented global health problem, affecting more than
a billion people worldwide. Consequences of IDD include goiter, cretinism,
intellectual impairment, brain damage, mental retardation, stillbirth,
congenital deformities, and increased perinatal mortality. Progress toward
eliminating IDDs has been substantial; an estimated 70% of the worldâs
edible salt currently is iodized. Most excess iodine is excreted, and most
people can tolerate fairly large amounts without experiencing problems. People
with a tendency toward autoimmune thyroid disease are less tolerant of excess
iodine. If a person has previously been iodine-deficient, that person may be
at risk for iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Excessive iodine intake by a
mother can pose a reproductive risk. Since urinary iodine values directly
reflect dietary iodine intake, urinary iodine analysis is the recommended and
most common method for biochemically assessing the iodine status of a
population. This method achieves rapid and accurate quantification of iodine
content in urine.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older. In previous years the data was performed
on a one-third subsample.



## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health.

Urine iodine and mercury concentrations are determined by ICP-DRC-MS
(Inductively Coupled Plasma Dynamic Reaction Cell Mass Spectroscopy). This
multielement analytical technique is based on quadrupole ICP-MS technology and
includes DRCâ¢ technology. Coupling radio frequency power into a flowing
argon stream seeded with electrons creates the plasma, the heat source, which
is ionized gas suspended in a magnetic field. Predominant species in the
plasma are positive argon ions and electrons. Diluted urine samples are
converted into an aerosol using a nebulizer inserted within the spray chamber.
A portion of the aerosol is transported through the spray chamber and then
through the central channel of the plasma, where it is exposed to temperatures
of 6000-8000 ÂºK. This thermal energy atomizes and ionizes the sample. The
ions and the argon enter the mass spectrometer through an interface that
separates the ICP, which is operating at atmospheric pressure (approximately
760 torr), from the mass spectrometer, which is operating at approximately
10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer permits detection of ions at each mass-to-
charge ratio in rapid sequence, which allows the determination of individual
isotopes of an element. Once inside the mass spectrometer, the ions pass
through the ion optics, then through DRCâ¢, and finally through the mass-
analyzing quadrupole, before being detected as they strike the surface of the
detector. The ion optics uses an electrical field to focus the ion beam into
the DRCâ¢. The DRCâ¢ component is pressurized with an appropriate reaction
gas and contains a quadrupole. Electrical signals resulting from the detection
of the ions are processed into digital information that is used to indicate
the intensity of the ions and subsequently the concentration of the element.
Traditionally ICP-MS has been a trace analysis technique and the typical
measurement ranges from < 0.1 Âµg/L to around 100 Âµg/L. DRC technology
provides additional control of ICP-MS sensitivity; therefore appropriate
adjustments of the reaction cell parameters can significantly extend the
useful concentration measurement range. In this method, iodine (isotope mass
127), tellurium (isotope mass 130), mercury (isotope mass 202) and bismuth
(isotope mass 209) are measured in urine by ICP-DRC-MS using 100% argon as the
Dynamic Reaction Cellâ¢ (DRC) gas utilizing collisional focusing. Urine
samples are diluted 1+1+ 8 (sample+ water + diluent) with water and diluent
containing tellurium and bismuth for internal standardization.

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the _General Documentation of Laboratory Data_ file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation, during
unscheduled visits, to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and
the quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation. Testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels are maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Scienceâs quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981).

Detailed quality control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in
the NHANES LPM. Read the _General Documentation on Laboratory Data_ file for
detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

**In previous years the data was performed on a one-third subsample, but for
2007-2008 it was performed on all survey participants.**

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

All the urinary iodine measures were above the limit of detection (1.0 Âµg/L)
for all samples. The detection limit divided by the square root of 2 is the
value that is provided for results that are below the limit of detection.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website.
