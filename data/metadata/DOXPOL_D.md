### Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), Dibenzofurans (PCDFs) &
Coplanar Polychlorinated Biphenyls (cPCBs) - Pooled Samples (DOXPOL_D)

####  Data File: DOXPOL_D.xpt

##### First Published: September 2015

##### Last Revised: November 2020

## Component Description

Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and dioxin-
like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) [coplanar and several mono-ortho-
substituted PCBs] are similar classes of chlorinated aromatic chemicals that
are produced as contaminants or byproducts. They have no known commercial or
natural use. Dioxins are produced primarily during the incineration or burning
of waste; the bleaching processes used in pulp and paper mills; and the
chemical syntheses of trichlorophenoxyacetic acid, hexachlorophene, vinyl
chloride, trichlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol. Both the synthesis and heat-
related degradation of PCBs will produce PCDF by-products. PCBs are
chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals that were once synthesized for use
as heat-exchanger, transformer, and hydraulic fluids, and also used as
additives to paints, oils, window caulking, and floor tiles.

Production of PCBs peaked in the early 1970s and was banned in the United
States after 1979. Together with the PCDDs and PCDFs, cPCBs and mPCBs are
often referred to as "dioxin-like" chemicals because they act in the body
through a similar mechanism.

In the environment, these dioxin-like chemicals are persistent and usually
occur as a mixture of congeners (i.e., compounds that differ by the numbers
and positions of chlorine atoms attached to the dibenzo-p-dioxin,
dibenzofuran, or biphenyl structures). The general population is exposed to
low levels of these dioxin-like chemicals primarily through ingestion of high-
fat foods such as dairy products, eggs, and animal fats, and some fish and
wildlife.  

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The 17 PCDDs/PCDFs, and four cPCBs were measured in serum by gas
chromatography/isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/ID-
HRMS). The analytical method for PCDDs/PCDFs/cPCB is described in Patterson et
al., 1990 and Turner et al., 1994. The method for PCBs is described in Sjodin
et al., 2004 and Barr et al., 2003.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2005-2006 cycle. However, the samples were measured in
a pooled fashion for 2005-2006 rather than individual measurements.  

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedure Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf). Vials
are stored under appropriate frozen (-30oC) conditions until they were shipped
to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2005-2006 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2005)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
details on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The original pooled-sample weight created for this file released in July 2013
was not correctly stratified to the U.S population total. This new file
contains the corrected sample weight (WTSMSMPA). No changes or corrections
were made to the lab analyte data in this new release. Any analyses of the
data using the old public use data file should be repeated using the corrected
sample weight on this file.

Dioxins and furans were measured in a one third subsample of persons 12 years
and over, and samples were pooled in groups of 8 samples per pool within 32
demographic groups. The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 pooled-sample data must
be conducted with the basic demographic variables provided in this data file.
This pooled-sample data file cannot be linked to other NHANES 2005-2006 data.
Because each sample person does not have an equal probability of selection,
sample weighting is needed to produce correct population estimates of means,
percentiles, and other descriptive statistics.

Samples were pooled in groups of 8 samples per pool within 40 demographic
groups. The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 pooled-sample data must be conducted
with the basic demographic variables provided in this data file. This pooled-
sample data file cannot be linked to other NHANES 2005-2006 data. Because each
sample person does not have an equal probability of selection, sample
weighting is needed to produce correct population estimates of means,
percentiles, and other descriptive statistics.

The pooled-sample weights required to produce estimates from these data are
included in this data file. The analysis of pooled-samples from survey data is
a relatively new field of study, and there is currently no established method
to produce variance estimates for these pooled results.   These data cannot be
analyzed using software designed for complex surveys because design features
are not available.

**Rationale and Methods Used to Create Pooled Results**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide an ongoing
assessment of the US population's exposure to environmental chemicals by using
Biomonitoring in conjunction with CDC's National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of
concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the US
population is a primary objective of CDC's Biomonitoring program.
Historically, this characterization has been based on individual measurements
of these compounds in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the
population. Pooling samples allows for larger sample volumes, which can result
in lower limits of detection and reduces the number of measurements and costs.
For the first time in NHANES 2005-2006, a weighted pooled-sample design was
implemented to facilitate pooling samples before making analytical
measurements (pooled results were not weighted in NHANES 2001-2002). Table 1
lists the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC)
names, common abbreviation, and NHANES variable name for the analytes included
in this data file.

Pools were prepared from serum collected from a random one-third subset of the
NHANES 2005-2006 participants aged 12 years and older. Samples were pooled
based on gender, race and Hispanic origin, and age. To implement the pooled-
sample design, each participant sample was identified as belonging to one of
32 demographic groups based on race and Hispanic origin (non-Hispanic white:
NHW, non-Hispanic black: NHB, Mexican American: MA,: OTHER, not non-Hispanic
black, non-Hispanic white or Mexican-American), gender (Male, Female), and age
group (12-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years of age and older). Eight (8) samples
were included in each pool. The number of pools created for each of the 32
demographic groups varied depending on the total number of individual samples
available in a demographic group. The one-third subset of NHANES 2005-2006
represents 2345 individual samples, but because the pooled-sample design
requires that all samples be of sufficient volume and that there be the same
number of samples in each pool, only 1973 samples were available to create 247
pools with 8 samples per pool.  See more details on pool sample formation and
exceptions in Table 2. The variable SAMPLEID denotes the identification number
for each pool and ranges from 1 through 247. Please refer to the Pooled-Sample
Technical Support file (POOLTF_D) for detailed information on individual
participants included in each pool.

In order to incorporate sample weighting into the pooled-sample design it was
necessary to use a different volume of material from each sample contributing
to a pool. The volume chosen for each sample in a pool was based on the ratio
of its sampling weight to the sum of the sampling weights of all samples in
the pool. To physically accomplish the pooling in the laboratory required that
the ratio of the largest to the smallest sampling weight of samples in the
same pool be no larger than about 4 or 5. The individual samples were
sorted/stratified by sampling weight within each of the 32 demographic groups
and pools were formed with sampling weights adjacent to one another in the
sorted list. The number of samples in the one-third subset, the number of
samples available, the number of these samples that were usable, and the
number of pools formed in each demographic group are presented in Table 2.
Once the pools were created, summed sampling weights were further adjusted to
account for the unused samples. These adjusted summed sampling weights are
represented by the variable named WTSMSMPA.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2005-2006
Demographics](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Laboratory&CycleBeginYear=2005)
includes auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the
time of venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**  

In the dataset, the whole weight detection limit (fg/g serum) is a variable
and dependent on the available sample size, however, the variation in sample
size was low. Lipid adjusted detection limits are variable (pg/g lipid) due to
differences of the lipid levels measured in individual pools/specimens. In
cases where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that
variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of 2.

**Methodological Considerations for analysis**

There are a few pooled-sample methodological publications, which address
issues related to the following topics (See References.)

• Variance estimation and bias correction when pooling samples from log-
normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2010b; Caudill et
al., 2007);  
• Models that incorporate measurement error when analyzing pooled-samples from
normally or log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a);  
• Incorporation of sample weighting into a pooled-sample design (Caudill,
2012; Caudill, 2010a);  
• Estimation of standard errors and confidence limits for point estimates from
pooled-samples (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a).
