## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operation in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are used in both residential and agricultural
settings in the United States. OP pesticides include malathion, diazinon,
chlorpyrifos, Guthion® (azinphosmethyl), parathion, and many others. All OP
pesticides have a common mode of toxicity because they are competitive
inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for deacetylation
of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Koelle G.B., 1994; Gompertz D., 1996).
Unfortunately, the toxic effects of OP pesticides are not unique to insects;
high doses can similarly affect wildlife and people.

OP pesticides were among the first of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA)-registered pesticides whose food tolerances were reassessed (EPA, 2017),
due to their common mode of toxicity and potential adverse effects in
vulnerable populations, such as children.

Most of the organophosphate pesticides registered for use in the United States
by the EPA are O, O-dimethyl, or O-diethyl substituted, which metabolize to
dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites. The six common DAP metabolites
(Dimethylphosphate, Diethylphosphate, Dimethylthiophosphate,
Dimethyldithiophosphate, Diethylthiophosphate, and Diethyldithiophosphate) do
not retain any of the structure unique to the pesticides from which they were
derived, so it is impossible to identify individual pesticides from these
metabolites. However, because these metabolites are common to the majority of
OP pesticides, they can provide invaluable information about cumulative
exposure to the OP class.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible in the NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method uses solid phase extraction (SPE) coupled with isotope dilution-
ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)-tandem mass spectrometry
(Jayatilaka N.K., et. al., 2017). The method relies on an enzymatic hydrolysis
of urinary conjugates, automated off-line SPE to pre-concentrate the target
compounds while minimizing urine matrix potential interferences to increase
the overall sensitivity and specificity. The deconjugated target analytes in
the urine extract are separated on an UHPLC system with reversed phase
chromatography and quantified by isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, and lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 or 2019-2020 cycles.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM). Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until
they were shipped to the Division of Laboratory Sciences for testing.

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al.,
1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et. al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate
for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
Laboratory Data Overview for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Organophosphate Pesticides - Dialkyl Phosphate Metabolites were measured in a
one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights
are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

For participants aged 3-5, their sample weights in this dataset (i.e.,
WTSBPRP) are equivalent to their MEC exam sample weights. These participants
have completed at least one physical exam component in the MEC; therefore,
they all have an exam sample weight larger than "0," regardless of their lab
test results. For participants 6 years and older in the dataset, special
sample weights were created for the subsample and encoded in variable WTSBPRP.
These special weights accounted for the additional probability of selection
into the subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if participants 6 years and older were selected as part of the one-
third subsample, but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the
sample weight value assigned as "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017- March 2020
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit was constant for the analyte in the data set. Two
variables are provided for this analyte. The variable name ending in "LC"
(ex., URDOP1LC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of detection,
"1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For the
analyte with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (URDOP1LC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The
variable prefixed URX (ex., URXOP1) provides the analytic result for that
analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for Organophosphate Pesticides -
Dialkyl Phosphate Metabolites:

Variable Name | Analyte Description | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URXOP1 | Dimethylphosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXOP2 | Diethylphosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXOP3 | Dimethylthiophosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXOP4 | Diethylthiophosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXOP5 | Dimethyldithiophosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1  
URXOP6 | Diethyldithiophosphate (ng/mL) | 0.1
