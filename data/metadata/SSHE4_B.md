### Human epididymal secretory protein E4 (HE4) - Serum (Surplus) (SSHE4_B)

####  Data File: SSHE4_B.xpt

##### First Published: May 2020

##### Last Revised: August 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed.

## Component Description

Sera from residual specimens from NHANES 2001-2002 participants were tested
for levels of human epididymal secretory protein E4 (HE4). The results for HE4
in this data release are reported as pM.

## Eligible Sample

Female participants age 20+ who consented to storing their samples for future
research and had stored samples from 2001-2002.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

All measurements were performed in the Genital Tract Biology Laboratory
(Brigham and Women's Hospital, Lab Director Fichorova) following pre-analytic,
analytic, and post-analytic standardized operational procedures (SOPs)
established under the Laboratory Director and special chemistry accreditation
by the College of American Pathologists. The lab used the Meso Scale Discovery
(MSD) (Gaithersburg, MD) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay platform.
Quality control (QC) pools were prepared and split into multiple aliquots. To
establish inter-and intra-plate variability, one aliquot of this pool was
repeatedly tested on each assay plate. A coefficient of variation of < 25% was
set as a threshold for acceptance of the data.

In further detail, the following assays and methodology were applied:

Human Prototype HE4 (96-well prototype plate 4 spot, catalog number N45YA-1)

The linearity range for the HE4 was 3600-0.55 pM (lowest limit of detection
(LLD) 0.006 pM). All samples were tested undiluted and 47 samples were
repeatedly tested to verify values <1 and >99 percentile. One plate was
repeated due to systematically lower/outlier values. Three QC samples were
used spanning three logs of the assay range: 1) a plasma pool prepared by
pooling a small volume (5 ul/ sample) from over 2000 serum samples which had
shown measurable HE4 levels in a prior study using the MSD platform1,2; 2) a
QC generated from a standard of known HE4 concentration; 3) a plasma pool
prepared by pooling samples obtained from a cohort of ovarian cancer cases.

The unblinded quality control sample pool repeatedly tested on every assay
plate showed the following inter-plate CV and min-max range (mean) of
intraplate CV of the three QCs tested: (i) QC #1, 18.3% inter-plate CV and
0.2%-9.2% (2.9%) intraplate CV; (ii) QC #2: 21.25% inter-plate CV and
0.2%-14.4% (3.3%) intraplate CV; and  iii) QC #3: 15.04% inter-plate CV and
0.3%-12.3% (3.1%) intraplate CV.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The acceptable QC pool variation was set to 25%. Back fit analysis of each
calibrator was also set to 25% acceptable level.  Outliers were confirmed by
repeated testing and samples outside the linearity range of each assay were
repeatedly tested at adjusted dilution to produce acceptable value.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data was compiled into a database after all the assays were completed and
passed quality control criteria. The data were not edited.

Data Access: All data will be made publicly available.

## Analytic Notes

Results were measured as pM.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on
the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
