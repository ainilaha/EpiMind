### Cytomegalovirus Genotypes - Urine (Surplus) (SSCMVG_A)

####  Data File: SSCMVG_A.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2017

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Among participants aged 6-49 years in NHANES between 1999 and 2004 who were
cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG positive, had stored urine samples available, tested
and found with urinary CMV shedding and sufficient DNA for genotyping.

## Eligible Sample

Surplus urine from individuals aged 6 to 49 years who participated in NHANES
years 1999 to 2004 and with urinary shedding (N=537).

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

DNA Extraction: DNA was extracted from urine specimens by treatment with the
QIAamp MinElute Media kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) then processed with the
Qiacube automated extractor (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), both following
manufacturer's instructions.  
  
PCR: The detection of CMV DNA was performed with polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) targeting the envelope glycoprotein gB and gH genes by Vries et al., and
using the MX 3005P Real-time PCR System (Agilent Technologies, New Castle,
DE).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Commercial reagents were used for all CMV detection. All QA/QC procedures
recommended by the manufacturer were followed. The laboratory follows
guidelines established by CDC Quality Management Systems (QMS) to ensure
overall quality and consistency in diagnostic testing.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were submitted after all the testing on CMV genotyping was complete. The
data were not edited.  
  
Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Analytic Notes

There are six variables:

gB1: CMV gB1 variant (1=Positive, 2=Negative, 3=Insufficient DNA)

gB2: CMV gB2 variant (1=Positive, 2=Negative, 3=Insufficient DNA)

gB3: CMV gB3 variant (1=Positive, 2=Negative, 3=Insufficient DNA)

gB4: CMV gB4 variant (1=Positive, 2=Negative, 3=Insufficient DNA)

gH1: CMV gH1 variant (1=Positive, 2=Negative, 3=Insufficient DNA)

gH2: CMV gH2 variant (1=Positive, 2=Negative, 3=Insufficient DNA)
