## Component Description

**Ethylene Oxide**

Ethylene oxide (EO) is an industrial chemical used to manufacture consumer and
non-consumer products and is used as a gaseous sterilant for medical devices.
EO has been classified as a human carcinogen (Group 1) by the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). EO has been detected in tobacco smoke,
automobile exhaust, and some foods (Clin Chem, 2016). EO is formed
endogenously in animals and humans from Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) mediated
metabolic oxidation of ethylene. It is also formed in vivo during normal
physiological processes, such as methionine oxidation, lipid peroxidation, and
during metabolic activity of intestinal bacteria. Information on endogenous
and exogenous EO exposure in the general population is very limited and is
needed to assess potential health effects associated with this exposure and to
monitor changes in exposure over time.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This procedure describes a method based on the modified Edman reaction to
measure hemoglobin adducts of EO in human whole blood or erythrocytes.
Specifically, the reaction products with the N-terminal valine residue of the
hemoglobin protein chains (N-[2-carbamoyl ethyl] valine and
N-[2-hydroxycarbamoyl-ethyl] valine EO adducts) are measured.

The modified Edman reaction uses the effect of N-alkylated amino acids to form
Edman products in neutral or alkaline conditions versus in acidic conditions
required in conventional Edman reaction procedures. It was first described for
N-terminal hemoglobin adducts of EO, propylene oxide, and styrene oxide and
later optimized to increase yield of Edman products of these adducts. This
optimized method was further refined and modified in-house to increase
sensitivity and enable automation.  

The procedure described here consists of 4 parts:

  * Preparation of the specimen for measurement of hemoglobin adducts EO; 
  * Measurement of total hemoglobin in the sample solution used for hemoglobin adduct measurements; 
  * Modified Edman reaction in the sample solution and isolation of Edman products; and 
  * Analysis of Edman products by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and results processing. 

The measurement is achieved using a commercial assay kit based on a well-
established procedure commonly used in clinical chemistry. Quantitation of
hemoglobin adducts of EO is performed using octapeptides with the same amino
acid sequence as the N-terminal of the beta-chain of hemoglobin with EO
attached at the valine residue.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory method used.

This is a new component in the 2013-2014 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

(December 2019)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Washed-packed red blood cell specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to
the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
[NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed quality
control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
MEC visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation, and testing procedures. Each
member is observed and given constructive feedback. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing blind
split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports describing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Hemoglobin adducts of EO were measured in a one-third subsample of
participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](http://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/FASTQX_H.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending
with "LC" (ex., LBDEOALC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" indicates that the result was at or above the limit
of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection.
The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXEOA) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with results below the lower limit of detection
(ex., LBDEOALC =1), an imputed value was provided. This value is the lower
limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in pmol/g Hb) for EO is:

**Variable Name  ** |  **  Analyte **Description**** |  **  LLOD**1  
---|---|---  
LBXEOA |  Hemoglobin adducts of EO |  8.20  
  
1 LLOD was adjusted for a calibrator bias, see section below for details.

**Bias adjustments Applied to Hemoglobin Adducts of Ethylene**  Oxide**
(LBXEOA)**  

A systematic bias was discovered for the measurement of hemoglobin adducts of
EO in red blood cells in the NHANES 2013 - 2014 and 2015 - 2016 cycles. The
bias was detected after a new batch of calibrators were used after LBXEOA
measurements were completed. The calibrators were obtained from a commercial
source. Further investigations conducted by the CDC testing laboratory
confirmed that the initial calibrator materials did not have the purity
specified by the manufacturer. This discrepancy between the anticipated
concentration of the calibrators and the actual concentration led to
systematic bias in LBXEOA results. The systematic nature of these biases
permitted retrospective adjustment through an algebraic correction using a
formula.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD) and the measurement values for LBXEOA were
initially adjusted in April 2022 and the revised data file released that same
month. The formula used to adjust measurements required logarithmic
transformation. However, the formula was applied to data that were not
uniformly log-transformed, rendering the revised measurement values released
in April 2022 invalid.

In May 2023, the LLOD and the measurement values for LBXEOA were correctly
adjusted using the following formula , which is based on log-transformed
measurement values:

_LBXEOA_ = 0.58026 (_LBXEOA_original_ 1.03562)





* * *

1The derivation of the formula is as follows:

log10 _[LBXEOA]_  = log10 (_LBXEOA_original_  *1.03562-0.23638)  
_LBXEOA_  = 10 log10(_LBXEOA_original  _*1.03562-0.23638)  
_LBXEOA_  = 0.58026 (_LBXEOA_original  _1.03562)
