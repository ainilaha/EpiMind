### Sexual Behavior (SXQ_D)

####  Data File: SXQ_D.xpt

##### First Published: March 2008

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The ACASI section on sexual behavior (SXQ) provides information on lifetime
and current sexual behavior for both men and women. Major items in this
section include age at first sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners,
sexual orientation, circumcision status (men) and history of sexually
transmitted diseases.

## Eligible Sample

Sample persons aged 14-59 years were eligible. Several questions in this
section are age and gender specific. Mentally impaired individuals or
participants who were unable to understand English or Spanish were not asked
these questions. Only data from participants aged 20-59 years are included in
this release. Special use data files for participants 14-19 years are
available through the NCHS Research Data Center.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The sexual behavior questionnaire was administered during the physical
examination, at the examination center in a private room, using the Audio
Computer Assisted Self Interview (ACASI) system for study participants 14 and
older.

The ACASI was conducted in either English or Spanish. The ACASI enables
respondents both to hear questions through earphones and read questions on the
computer screen. Respondents move at their own speed and touch the screen to
indicate their response. No proxy respondents or translators were used in
situations when the respondents could not self-report.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

For details on the QA/QC process for this component, please refer to the MEC
Interview Manual on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Responses to SXD031 (age at first sexual intercourse) that were 9 years or
less were grouped and coded as "9 years or younger."

Responses to SXD171 (# of female partners) that were 2000 or more partners
were grouped and coded as "2000 or more" partners.

## Analytic Notes

Questions have changed from the NHANES Sexual Behavior 2003-2004 Public Data
Release. Many of these changes were rewording of the questions to make them
more specific (see table 1), as well as new questions added (see table 2).
Analysts should take this into account and make sure they are familiar with
all the questions before trying to merge datasets.

Compared to past NHANES cycles, the prevalence has gone up for respondents
answering "No" to ever having sex, including respondents who were pregnant at
exam, gave a history of pregnancy or self-reported being married, divorced,
widowed, separated, or living with a partner. Analysts are advised to recode
SXQ021 based on pregnancy status, ever been pregnant and marital status. Data
will be missing for most of the variables in the sexual behavior section for
these respondents since an answer of "No" to SXQ021 skips the respondent out
of the questionnaire, with an exception of one other question for females and
2 other questions for males.

Although this issue is more pronounced in the 2005-2006 data release, this was
also an issue in previous releases. If analysts are planning to combine data
with previous cycles they may want to consider the same type of recode for
SXQ020.

Pregnancy Status (RIDEXPRG): If pregnancy status is coded as "1", or 'Yes,
positive lab pregnancy test or self-reported pregnant at exam', then analyst
should recode SXQ021 (Have you ever had vaginal, anal, or oral sex?) to equal
"1" or 'Yes'. There were approximately 13 women who reported "2" or 'No' to
SXQ021 who were pregnant at exam. Below is a table illustrating the prevalence
of women for the 2005-2006 data reporting "no" to SXQ021 based on pregnancy
status.

Pregnancy History (RHQ131): If RHQ131 (Have you ever been pregnant? Please
include current pregnancy, live births, miscarriages, stillbirths, tubal
pregnancies and abortions.) is equal to "1", or 'Yes', then analyst are urged
to recode SXQ021 to "1" or 'Yes'. Below is a table illustrating the prevalence
of women for the 2005-2006 data reporting "no" to SXQ021 based on pregnancy
history.

 Marital Status (DMDMARTL): Analyst are urged to recode SXQ021 to "1" if the
marital status =:  
"1" (Married)  
"2" (Widowed)  
"3" (Divorced)  
"4" (Separated)  
"6" (Living with Partner)

Users are cautioned about the use of SXQ292 and SXQ294 in analyses, especially
in analyses that classify respondents by their responses to these questions to
describe or compare subgroup characteristics. The sample size for the non-
heterosexual subgroups is limited and do not meet the minimum sample size
requirements for statistical reliability as noted in the NHANES analytic
guidelines1. Even after combining multiple years of data, which is often
recommended to estimate rarer conditions within a subgroup, the non-
heterosexual subgroups do not meet the minimum sample size. Additionally,
there is a high rate of not selecting a specific answer to the questions. That
is, selecting 'don't know', 'refused', 'not sure' or 'something else' as a
response. This issue has been examined at length at the NCHS Questionnaire
Design Research Laboratory (QDRL) recently. Individuals select these answers
for a variety of reasons that are well summarized in the report Design,
Development and Testing of the NHIS Sexual Identity Question2, specifically in
Table 2. For example, respondents from the LGBT community select "something
else' when they use a different sexual identity label than those presented in
the response options. However, those who aren't part of the LGBT community
select this answer because they are not familiar with what the response
options mean.

 Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues on the NHANES website. The Analytic
Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
