# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2005-2006 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Reproductive Health (RHQ_D)

####  Data File: RHQ_D.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2007

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

This section contains questions for women only on reproductive health
including menstrual history, pregnancy history, lactation, oral contraceptive
and hormone replacement therapy use and other related conditions. Several
questions were new in 2005, some questions were slightly modified, and others
were omitted (see Analytic notes).

## Eligible Sample

Female mobile exam center (MEC) participants, 12 years and older were
eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked at the Mobile Examination Center (MEC), during the
MEC Interview, using the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI)
system.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Approximately 5% of the interviews were recorded and reviewed for quality
control purposes.

## Data Processing and Editing

The reproductive health questionnaire is a complex, detailed set of questions
that includes the administration of questions according to age group or skip
patterns based on responses to various reproductive health conditions. While
data were reviewed and edited for completeness ad illogical values, some
inconsistencies in the response to the self-reported questions remain. Data
analysts are strongly encouraged to carefully review all variables of interest
prior to data analysis.

## Analytic Notes

New and modified variables, and excluded variables from RHQ_C 2003-4 data
release:

New:

**RHQ166:** Number of vaginal deliveries  
**RHQ169:** Number of Caesarian deliveries.  
**RHQ171:** Number of deliveries resulting in a live birth (modification of
RHD170: Number of pregnancies resulting in live birth)  
Excluded:  
**RHQ700,** and **RHQ710A-G:** Feminine hygiene products used in past month.  
**RHQ720:** Douche in past 6 months  
**RHQ730:** Frequency of douching in past 6 months

Notes about specific variables:

**RHD080:** Days since last period. Women who reported having had a menstrual
period in the past 2 months were asked to report the date of their last
menstrual period. The derived variable was created by subtracting the number
of days between the reported month and day the period began and the date of
the MEC interview. Please note that for this variable extreme values were
retained and should be carefully examined prior to analysis. There are several
instances of women who reported that they were currently menstruating (RHQ051)
who provided a date which may indicate that they were reporting a date that
was not their most recent period but the one previous to that one.

**RHQ171:** Number of deliveries resulting in a live birth. If the total
number of deliveries resulting in live births was greater than 11, the number
was top coded to 11 for the purpose of confidentiality. Note: there are six
cases where the number of deliveries resulting in a live birth is greater than
the number of pregnancies reported in RHQ160. This may have occurred as a
result of women reporting multiple lives births as in the case of twins rather
than as single "deliveries."

**RHQ180:** Age at first live birth. If a woman only had one live birth
(RHQ171=1), the age at the time of that live birth is reported in RHQ190 (age
at last live birth).

**RHQ291:** Age when had hysterectomy Please note that there are 14 instances
in which women reported an age of hysterectomy that is earlier than the age of
last menstrual period (RHQ060).

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website.
