### Polyfluoroalkyl Chemicals (PFC_G)

####  Data File: PFC_G.xpt

#####  First Published: February 2014

#####  Last Revised: October 2014

## Component Description

Organic fluorochemicals are used in multiple commercial applications including
surfactants, lubricants, paints, polishes, food packaging and fire-retarding
foams. Several of these polyfluorochemicals (PFCs) are ubiquitous contaminants
found both in humans and animals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)
has been used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer products including
protective coatings for carpets and apparel, paper coatings, insecticide
formulations, and surfactants. In May 2000, the 3M Company, the sole
manufacturer of PFOS in the United States and the principal manufacturer
worldwide, announced that it was discontinuing the production of
perfluorooctanyl fluoride-based chemistries, including PFOS. Perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA) is used primarily to produce salts which are used in the
production of fluoroelastomers and fluoropolymers, such as
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF). PTFE has
numerous uses in many industrial and consumer products, including coatings on
textiles and carpet; uses in the automotive, mechanical, aerospace, chemical,
electrical, medical, and building/construction industries; personal care
products; and non-stick coatings on cookware. PVDF is used primarily in
electrical/electronics, building/construction, and chemical processing
industrial sectors.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Solid phase extraction coupled to High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Turbo
Ion Spray ionization-tandem Mass Spectrometry (online SPE-HPLC-TIS-MS/MS) is
used for the quantitative detection of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA),
2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),
2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Et-PFOSA-AcOH),
perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBuS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS),
perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA),
perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate
(PFDeA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUA), and perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA).
Briefly, after dilution with formic acid, one aliquot of 100 μL of serum is
injected into a commercial column switching system allowing for concentration
and chromatographic separation of the analytes. Detection and quantification
are done using tandem mass spectrometry (Kuklenyik Z, et al. 2005).

Refer to NHANES 2011-2012 [Lab Methods for Polyfluoroalkyl
Chemicals](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/labmethods/pfc_g_met.pdf)
for detailed description of the laboratory method used.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES [Laboratory
Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2011-2012/manuals/2011-12_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) used
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (Westgard et al,1981; Caudill
et al. 2008).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/fastqx_g.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Subsample weights**

Serum polyfluorinated chemicals were measured in a one third subsample of
persons 12 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
LBD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable named LBX___ provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (i.e., URD___LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt(2)).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for each polyfluorochemical is:

Analyte | Item Id | LLOD  
---|---|---  
Perfluorooctanoic acid | LBXPFOA | 0.10  
Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid | LBXPFOS | 0.20  
Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid | LBXPFHS | 0.10  
2-(N-Ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid | LBXEPAH | 0.10  
2-(N-Methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid | LBXMPAH | 0.09  
Pefluorodecanoic acid | LBXPFDE | 0.10  
Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid | LBXPFBS | 0.10  
Perfluoroheptanoic acid | LBXPFHP | 0.10  
Perfluorononanoic acid | LBXPFNA | 0.08  
Perfluorooctane sulfonamide | LBXPFSA | 0.10  
Perfluoroundecanoic acid | LBXPFUA | 0.10  
Perflurododecanoic acid | LBXPFDO | 0.10  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/nhanes/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
