## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Albumin measurements are used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases
involving the liver and/or kidneys. These measurements are frequently used to
assess nutritional status, due to plasma levels of albumin being dependent on
protein intake. Increased microalbuminuria is a sign of renal disease and may
be predictive of nephropathy risk in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
It is also associated with hypertension and cardiac disease.

Creatinine is produced by creatine and creatinine phosphate as a result of
muscle metabolic processes. It is then excreted by glomerular filtration
during normal renal function. Creatinine may be measured in both serum and
urine. Creatinine measurement is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of
renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for
other urinary analytes (e.g., total protein and microalbumin).

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants 3 years and older, in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample, were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Urinary Albumin**

A solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay for the measurement of human urinary
albumin is described by Chavers et al., 1984. The fluorescent immunoassay is a
non-competitive, double-antibody method for the determination of human albumin
in urine. Antibody to human albumin is covalently attached to derivatized
polyacrylamide beads. The solid-phase antibody is reacted with a urine
specimen, and the urine albumin-antigen complexes with the solid-phase
antibody. This complex then reacts with fluorescein-labeled antibody. The
unattached fluorescent antibody is then removed by washing during
centrifugation. The fluorescence of the stable solid-phase antibody complex is
determined with a fluorometer; the fluorescence is directly proportional to
the amount of urine albumin present. The standard curve is 0.5-20 μg/mL of
albumin.

Results of the fluorescent immunoassay (FIA) are reproducible, and the test is
accurate and sensitive for the detection of human urinary albumin excretion.
It is especially useful for the measurement of low levels of urinary albumin
not detectable by dipstick methods. The FIA assay resembles the radio-
immunoassay (RIA) in technique and sensitivity without the potential health
hazards associated with the handling of isotopes in the laboratory (Chavers,
BM et al., 1984).

**Urinary Creatinine**

Creatinine is produced by creatine and creatinine phosphate as a result of
muscle metabolic processes. It is then excreted by glomerular filtration
during normal renal function. Creatinine may be measured in both serum and
urine. Creatinine measurement is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of
renal diseases, in monitoring renal dialysis, and as a calculation basis for
other urinary analytes (e.g., total protein, microalbumin).

In this enzymatic method creatinine is converted to creatine under the
activity of creatininase. Creatine is then acted upon by creatinase to form
sarcosine and urea. Sarcosine oxidase converts sarcosine to glycine and
hydrogen peroxide, and the hydrogen peroxide reacts with chromophore in the
presence of peroxidase to produce a color product that is measured at 546 nm
(secondary wavelength = 700 nm). This is an endpoint reaction that agrees well
with recognized HPLC methods, and it has the advantage over Jaffe picric acid-
based methods that are susceptible to interferences from non-creatinine
chromogens.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to University of Minnesota,
Minneapolis, MN for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures
Manuals](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) (LPM). Vials are stored under
appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are shipped to University of
Minnesota for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Three variables were created in this data file. The variables were created
using the following formulas:

**URXUMA and URXUMS:**

The urine albumin value in µg/mL (URXUMA) was converted to mg/L (URXUMS) by
multiplying by 1.00 (rounded 2 decimals).

**URXUCR and URXCRS:**  

The urine creatinine value in mg/dL (URXUCR) was converted to µmol/L (URXCRS)
by multiplying by 88.4 (rounded 1 decimal).

**URDACT:**  

The urine albumin/creatinine ratio in mg/g (URDACT) was calculated by dividing
URXUMA by URXUCR and multiplying by 100 (rounded 2 decimal places).

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate
for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Refer to the [2017-2018
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)and
[2019 - 2020 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-March 2020 Pre-
pandemic Demographics File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URXUMALC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUMA) provides the analytic
result for that analyte.  For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., URXUMALC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD) in ug/ml for URXUMA and in mg/dL for
URXUCR:

**Variable Name  ** |  **Analyte description  ** |  **  LLOD**  
---|---|---  
 URXUMA |   Albumin, Urine |   0.30 µg/mL  
 URXUCR |   Creatinine, urine (mg/dL) |   5.00 mg/dL
