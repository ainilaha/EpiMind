### Glycohemoglobin (GHB_I)

####  Data File: GHB_I.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2017

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Diabetes mellitus will be assessed by measuring blood glycohemoglobin, fasting
plasma glucose, 2-hour glucose (Oral Glucose Tolerance Test), and serum
insulin in participants aged 12 years and over.

Glycohemoglobin measures are available for a full sample.

Diabetes is a leading cause of disease and death in the United States. More
than 29 million Americans are living with diabetes, and 86 million are living
with prediabetes, a serious health condition that increases a person's risk of
type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases. In 2014, nearly 9.3 percent of all
deaths for persons over the age of 25 were among people with diabetes. The
prevalence of diabetes and overweight (one of the major risk factors for
diabetes) continue to increase. Substantial new efforts to prevent or control
diabetes have begun, including the Diabetes Prevention Trial and the National
Diabetes Education Program.

Diabetes testing provides population data to: 1) determine a national estimate
of diabetes prevalence (diagnosed and undiagnosed); 2) identify the risk
factors; 3) permit a national cohort to be established for follow-up studies
of this condition; and 4) provide critical information to clinicians and
public health officials for the development of preventive care and community-
based interventions.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

In this assay, the stable (SA1c) and labile (LA1c) A1c forms can be
individually resolved on the chromatogram without manual pretreatment,
allowing accurate measurement of the stable form of HbA1c. The analyzer
dilutes the whole blood specimen with a hemolysis solution, and then injects a
small volume of the treated specimen onto the HPLC analytical column.
Separation is achieved by utilizing differences in ionic interactions between
the cation exchange group on the column resin surface and the hemoglobin
components. The hemoglobin fractions (A1c, A1b, F, LA1c, SA1c, A0 and H-Var)
are subsequently removed from the column material by step-wise elution using
elution buffers each with a different salt concentration. The separated
hemoglobin components pass through the photometer flow cell where the analyzer
measures changes in absorbance at 415 nm. The analyzer integrates and reduces
the raw data, and then calculates the relative percentages of each hemoglobin
fraction. Analysis requires three minutes.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

(September 2017)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the University of
Missouri-Columbia, MO for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate refrigerated (6°C) conditions until they
are shipped to University of Missouri for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the University of Missouri's quality control and
quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to
the Westgard rules.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015 - 2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2015-2016/fastqx_i.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.

The laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data files using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**  
Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower LLODs isn't
applicable.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
