### Perfluoroalkyl Chemicals - Serum (Surplus) (SSPFC_A)

####  Data File: SSPFC_A.xpt

##### First Published: October 2006

##### Last Revised: December 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at
serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

 _Update to terminology: The now widely accepted term for perfluorinated
chemicals used here is perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)_.
The primary objective of this study was to characterize serum concentrations
of selected perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs), including perfluoroctanoate
(PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), in a representative random 1/3
subset of the non-occupationally exposed US population from NHANES 1999-2000,
so that we could obtain national population levels for these compounds over
this two-year period.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The measurements of PFCs were performed at the Division of Laboratory Sciences
(DLS), National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH), Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC). Through a multiple reaction monitoring
experiment, the following analytes were measured: perfluorooctane sulfonamide
(PFOSA), 2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Et-PFOSA-AcOH),
2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),
perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), PFOS, PFOA, perfluorohexanoic acid
(PFHxA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDeA),
perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA), and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA). The
analytical method used has been described in detail (Kuklenyik et al. 2005).
Briefly, without protein precipitation, only dilution with 0.1 M formic acid,
one aliquot of 100 μL of serum was injected into a commercial column switching
system allowing for concentration of the analytes on a C18 solid-phase
extraction column. This column was placed automatically in front of a C8
analytical high-performance liquid chromatography column for chromatographic
separation of the analytes. Detection and quantification were done using
negative-ion TurboIonSpray ionization, a variant of electrospray ionization,
tandem mass spectrometry. Three isotope-labeled internal standards were used
for quantification: 18O2-PFOSA, 18O2-PFOS, and 13C2-PFOA. To compensate for
the lack of isotope-labeled internal standards for the other analytes and
account for matrix effects, the calibration standards were spiked into calf
serum. Spiked serum was analyzed repeatedly to determine the limit of
detection (LOD), accuracy, and precision of the method. LOD was calculated as
3S0, where S0 is the standard deviation as the concentration approaches zero
(Taylor 1987). The standard accuracies (77%-109%) and their relative standard
deviations (5%-24%) were obtained at three spike levels (LOD, 1.25 ng/mL and
12.5 ng/mL) (Kuklenyik et al. 2005). To correct for the endogenous PFOS
present in the calf serum, we increased the calculated PFOS concentrations by
0.6 ng/mL. No corrections were applied to the other PFC concentrations
(Kuklenyik et al. 2005).

## Data Processing and Editing

Specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to DLS, NCEH, CDC (Atlanta,
Georgia). Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are
discussed in the NHANES LPM. Read the LABDOC file for detailed data processing
and editing protocols. The analytical method is described in detail in a peer-
reviewed publication (Kuklenyik et al. 2005).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

CDC's laboratory is CLIA '88 certified and practices all quality control (QC)
and assurance procedures dictated by this certification. Serum concentrations
of PFCs currently have no known clinical significance other than indicating
exposure to PFCs prior to specimen collection in 1999-2000. Therefore, no
reports will be forwarded to NHANES survey participants.

QC procedures included the daily analysis of characterized serum pools and the
periodic analysis of proficiency testing materials. Low-concentration (QCL; ~3
ng/mL to ~9 ng/mL, depending upon the analyte) and high-concentration (QCH;
~10 ng/mL to ~30 ng/mL, depending upon the analyte) QC materials were prepared
from a base calf serum pool, dispensed in 3-mL aliquots and stored at −20 °C.
QC materials were characterized through repeated measurements spanning at
least 3 weeks, to define the mean concentrations and the 95% and 99% control
limits of PFCs. The coefficients of variation of 30 repeated measurements for
each serum pool ranged between 6% and 16% for all analytes (Kuklenyik et al.
2005). Each analytical batch of NHANES samples also included 9 calibration
standards, 2 QCH, 2 QCL, 2 reagent blanks, and 1 serum blank. The
concentrations of the two QCH and the two QCL were averaged to obtain one
measurement of QCH and of QCL per batch; these concentrations were evaluated
using standard statistical probability rules.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 1999-2000 PFCs data must be conducted with the key
survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 1999-2000 Household
Questionnaire Data files contain demographic data, health indicators, and
other related information collected during household interviews. They also
contain all survey design variables and sample weights. The phlebotomy file
includes auxiliary information such as the conditions precluding venipuncture.
The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may be linked to the
laboratory data file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., SEPAHLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable (ex., SEPAH) provides the analytic result for that analyte. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
SEPAHLC=1), the value of the lower limit of detection (LLOD) was placed in the
analyte results field. No imputation was performed in this file. For other
cycles containing these analytes, data instead have an imputed fill value
placed in the analyte results field when falling below the LLOD
(LLOD/sqrt[2]). For those interested in consistency with other cycles
containing these analytes, suggested imputation values to replace data below
the LLOD are provided in the table below.  

The lower limits of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) and suggested imputation values
are:

Analyte | Item Id | LLOD | Suggested Imputation Value (LLOD/sqrt[2])  
---|---|---|---  
2-(N-Ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid | SEPAH | 0.2 | 0.14  
2-(N-Methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid | SMPAH | 0.17 | 0.12

Perfluoroundecanoic acid | SPFUA | 0.2 | 0.14
