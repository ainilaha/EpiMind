### Total Testosterone (TST_G)

####  Data File: TST_G.xpt

##### First Published: January 2014

##### Last Revised: March 2014

## Component Description

This data will establish baseline data to assist in disease diagnosis and the
treatment and prevention of diseases such as, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome
(PCOS), androgen deficiency, cancer, and hormone imbalances in children. An
estimated 5 to 7 million women in the United States (U.S) suffer with the
effects of PCOS. It is the most common hormonal disorder among women of
reproductive age, which can occur as young as 11 years old, and is the leading
cause of infertility. The prevalence of symptomatic androgen deficiency in men
between 30 and 79 years of age is estimated to be 5.6%. This increases
substantially with age, affecting approximately 4 to 5 million men in the U.S.
The aging of the U.S. male population will cause a large increase in the
burden of symptomatic androgen deficiency.

Measurement of testosterone (T measurements) based on current research could
provide insight into the diagnosis of several diseases and disorders. Examples
include the detection of hormone-secreting tumors found in the breast and
prostate. Elevated levels of testosterone in serum might be associated with
certain prostate cancers. Additionally, it has been observed that changes in
hormone levels in population studies were associated with several diseases
including coronary artery disease and diabetes in men. As a result, T
measurements could be used to report possible risk factors.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older, who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria, are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Measurements of total testosterone in serum are performed using isotope
dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (ID-LC-MS/MS) method
for routine analysis developed by CDC. The method was created for high sample
throughput and demonstrates high accuracy and precision over multiple years.
It is certified by CDC Hormone Standardization Program (HoSt) and is traceable
to certified reference materials obtained from Australian National Measurement
Institute, ANMI M914, Australian for testosterone (Zhou, et al, 2017).

## Data Processing and Editing

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20Â°C) conditions until they are shipped to
the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

This file contains no top coding.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed quality
control and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2011-2012
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/fastqx_g.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Please refer to the NHANES Analytic Guidelines and the on-line NHANES Tutorial
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
The Analytic Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
