### Vitamin A, Vitamin E & Carotenoids (L45VIT_C)

####  Data File: L45VIT_C.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2007

#####  Last Revised: NA

#####  Note: This file is updated to add vitamins A, E, and Carotenoids data
and regression

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are:

  1. to provide data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 
  2. to evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status; and 
  3. to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. 

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Vitamin A, Vitamin E, and Carotenoids

Serum concentrations of vitamin A (retinol, retinyl palmitate, retinyl
stearate), vitamin E (α-, δ-, and γ-tocopherols), and twelve carotenoids
(lutein, zeaxanthin, α-cryptoxanthin, β-cryptoxanthin, trans-lycopene,cis-
lycopene, α-carotene, trans-β-carotene, cis-β-carotene, ciscombined
lutein/zeaxanthin,phytoene and phytofluene) are measured using high
performance liquid chromatography with multiwavelength photodiode-array
absorbance detection. A small volume (150 μL) of serum/plasma is mixed with an
equal volume of buffer, and then mixed with 2 volumes of ethanol containing
the internal standard (tocol). The analytes are extracted from the aqueous
phase into hexane. The combined hexane extracts are dried under vacuum. The
extract is redissolved in ethyl acetate and diluted in mobile phase. An
aliquot is injected onto a C18 reversed phase column and eluted isocratically.
The analytes all possess absorbance and/or fluorescence which are proportional
to their concentration in solution; therefore these properties are used for
quantitative analysis. The mode of detection is chosen to provide the highest
sensitivity and selectivity. Carotenoids are measured by absorbance at 450 nm.
Retinol, retinyl esters, phytoene and phytofluene are measured by UV
absorbance near their absorption maxima of 325 nm, 280 nm and 340 nm.
Tocopherols have absorption maxima between 292 and 300 nm. Chromatograms are
recorded using a computer data system. Analytes are quantified by external
standard quantitation using standards to calculate response factors based on
the peak area of the analyte. The quantities of analytes are corrected for
recovery post-run based upon tocol asan internal standard.

Laboratory testing changed from 2001-2002 and 2003-2004. The National Center
for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease & Prevention performed the
testing in 2001-2002. Craft Technologies performed the testing in 2003-2004.
Craft Technologies measured more analytes in 2003-2004 than theNational Center
for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease & Prevention measured in
2001-2002. See the codebooks on the NHANES website for the different tests
between the two laboratories.

The age group in which these measurements were made changed from 2001-2002 to
2003-2004. Serum concentrations of vitamin A, vitamin E and carotenoids were
tested on participants 3 years and older in 2001- 2002 and on participants 6
years and older in 2003-2004.

The variable names and/or label descriptors changed from 2001-2002 to
2003-2004 for vitamin E and lutein/zeaxanthin. Also, additional analytes were
tested in 2003-2004. The following pairs of test names or codes are used
synonymously; vitamin E and α-tocopherol; and vitamin A and retinol. The
variable names for vitamin E/α-tocopherol changed from LBXVIE/LBDVIESI in
2001-2002 to LBXATC/LBDATCSI in 2003-2004.

The variable name and label descriptor for lutein (LBXLUT/LBXLUTSI) in the
2002 and earlier data is equivalent to the variable name "combined
lutein/zeaxanthin" (LBXLUZ/LBXLUZSI) in the 2003-2004 data. This is because
the lutein peak in the CDC method included both lutein and zeaxanthin.

Serum concentrations of α-cryptoxanthin (LBXACY/LBDACYSI), δ\-
tocopherol(LBXDTC/LBDDTCSI), cis-lycopene (LBXCLC/LBDCLCSI), total lycopene
(LBXLCC/LBDLCCSI), lutein (LBXLUT/LBDLUTSI), phytofluene (LBXPHF/LBDPHFSI),
phytoene (LBXPHE/LBDPHESI),  
and zeaxanthin (LBXZEA/LBDZEASI) were measured in 2003-2004, but not in
2001-2002.

A detailed description of the laboratory method used can be found on the
NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to CTI in Wilson, NC for
analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES LPM. Vials werestored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until
they were shipped to CTI.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found on
the NHANES website.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Household Questionnaire Data Files also contain all survey
design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

**Regression Analysis for 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 for Vitamins A, E, and
Carotenoids:**

In 2001-2002, Vitamins A, E and Carotenoids were analyzed using a HPLC method
performed at CDC/NCEH [See Lab 6 in NHANES 2001-2002 for method details]. In
2003-2004, Vitamins A, E and Carotenoids were analyzed using a comparable HPLC
method at Craft Technologies, Inc. (CTI). Crossover studies between CDC/NCEH
and CTI were done in early 2003 and late 2004 and differences existed between
the methods for some analytes. The following Deming regression analyses were
performed to compare data from 2001-2002 to 2003-2004:
