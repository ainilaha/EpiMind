### Food Security (FSQ)

####  Data File: FSQ.xpt

#####  First Published: November 2004

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Food Security section (FSQ) covers a variety of areas relating to lack of
adequate food and receipt of food assistance in various forms. FSQ items were
included in various parts of the NHANES survey, both in the household
interview and in the Mobile Exam Center (MEC). These are listed and described
separately.  
  
**USDA food adequacy indicator**

The USDA food adequacy (sufficiency) indicator was administered to one adult
in the household, even if it consisted of more than one family. This indicator
has been included on numerous surveys, with a variety of answer choices. On
NHANES, there were four answer choices:

  1. enough and kinds of food wanted, 
  2. enough but not always kinds wanted, 
  3. sometimes not enough, 
  4. often not enough. 

Interview setting: Home  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: All households. One adult responds.  
Release level: All household members  
  
**U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module (FSSM)**

The 18-item module, formerly known as the "Core food security module" was
administered to one adult in a household, even if there was more than one
family in the household. The questions referred to all household members, even
if they were not individual participants in NHANES. The FSSM has been used on
many other surveys, including the Current Population Survey (CPS), whose
results are used to provide an estimate of the percent of US households that
is food insecure and that experiences hunger.

Interview setting: Home  
Mode of administration: In-person  
Eligible sample: All households, but high income households were screened out
of the questions. One adult responds.  
Release level: All household members

**Food program participation**

NHANES included questions on receipt of benefits from the Special Supplemental
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), food stamp receipt,
and reduced price or free school meals. Data on subsidized school meals are
released with the Diet Behavior section (DBQ); WIC and food stamp data are in
this FSQ release. Questions about WIC were asked at the household level and at
the individual child and mother level.

## Data Processing and Editing

**Data collection**

**Food Adequacy Indicator**

The USDA food adequacy indicator (FSD.010) was asked during the family
interview which is part of the interview that takes place in the home. The
item had four answer choices, allowing for indication of adequacy (quality) as
well as sufficiency (quantity). Although the standard follow-up questions
asking about reasons for reported food insufficiency or inadequacy were also
asked, these data are not released because of confidentiality concerns. Most
households reporting "sometimes" or "often" not enough food said that the
reason was "not enough money for food." The same USDA indicator and the
follow-up questions were included in NHANES III, and versions have been used
in many other surveys, including the Continuing Survey of Food Intake in
Individuals (CSFII), administered by USDA. In NHANES this item was asked as
part of what is termed the "family interview", but it actually refers to the
entire household and is asked of one adult respondent, even if the household
contains multiple families. All households received this item.

**Food Security Survey Module (FSSM)**

NHANES 1999-2000 contains the 18-item U.S. Food Security Survey Module
(formerly known as the Core Module) which is used in numerous surveys,
including the Current Population Survey (CPS) and is the basis for national
level reports of food insecurity and hunger. This module was part of the
family interview but was asked at the household level and answered by one
adult respondent, even if there were multiple families in the household. Not
all households screened into the FSSM. Screening into the module was based
upon response to the USDA food adequacy indicator and/or income. Screens
within the module itself were based on answers to prior questions. Screens
were not always implemented consistently, because of computer programming
errors and glitches as well as procedural changes. Data are released in four
categories: Food secure, marginally food secure, food insecure without hunger,
food insecure with hunger.

**WIC**

A question about receipt of any WIC benefits in the past 12 months was asked
in the family interview. The question was asked about the entire household and
was answered by one adult respondent, even if there were multiple families in
the household. Questions about an individual child participant's WIC benefits
- past 12 months, current, and duration- were asked in the diet behavior
section (DBQ) of the interview and were answered by an adult respondent.
Children up to 5 years of age were eligible. Women who were pregnant,
lactating, or within 6 months of birth were asked about WIC benefits in the
MEC, as part of the Reproductive Health Section (RHQ). Household, child, and
mother data on receipt of WIC benefits are released.

**Food Stamps**

Questions about authorization to receive food stamps were included in the FSQ
section of the family interview and were answered by one adult respondent. The
questions asked about authorization for anyone in the household, who in the
household was authorized, how many months in the past 12 months the person was
authorized, and whether the person was now authorized. Data are released on
number of people in household authorized for food stamps, individual
authorization, number of months received in past 12 months, and current
authorization. Individual level data are not available for all participants.

**Data Editing**

**Food Security Survey Module (FSSM)**

When screening procedures and skips operated correctly, respondents with no
prior affirmative responses and/or high income were skipped out of some
subsequent questions. Responses to the subsequent questions were coded as
negative.  
  
Where data were missing for a specific item not resulting from a valid skip,
results were imputed when possible, using the instructions for imputing given
in the "Guide to Measuring Household Food Security, Revised 2000." Series of
truly missing data could not be imputed and were left as missing.

Screening for entry into the Food Security Survey Module varied over the two
years, using response to the USDA food adequacy indicator or reported income
to screen out some households. Households screened out of questions were
presumed to have responded negatively to all FSSM items.

Several of the internal screens in the FSSM did not always work correctly.
Where possible, the data were edited to simulate these screens. Where this was
not possible, data are missing.

FSSM responses were used to create three categorical measures of food security
for households with children and two for households without children.  
  
The household measure uses all 18 items (or 10 items for households without
children) in a manner consistent with the CPS categorical measure, depicted on
page 31 of the "Guide to Measuring Household Food Security, Revised 2000"
(<http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsec/FILES/FSGuide.pdf>). The four categories
created for household food security are: food secure, marginally food secure
("at risk" in the guide), food insecure without hunger, and food insecure with
hunger (moderate and severe hunger have been combined into one category).

The adult measure uses 10 items to create four response categories. These
categories are the same as those used for the household measure, but they
utilize only the household and adult items and label names differ slightly.
The adult measure is scored the same as the household scale for households
with adults only (uses 10 items), whether or not there are children in the
household. Thus, for adult-only households, the household and adult measures
are identical.

It is further described in documentation on the Survey of Program Dynamics  
<http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/FoodSecurity/spd/spd98.pdf> and
<http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/FoodSecurity/spd/spd01.pdf>

The child measure categorization is based upon the ERS research report
"Measuring Children's Food Security in U.S. Households, 1995-99"  
(<http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/fanrr25/fanrr25.pdf>), which uses the 8
child-referenced items to classify households into two categories (no or
insufficient evidence of hunger; clear evidence of hunger). However, the
NHANES data are grouped into four categories, for consistency with the
household and adult measures. The first category in the ERS report is
separated into three categories (food quantity and quality unaffected (0),
marginally food secure (1), and food insecure without hunger 2-4). The most
severe category is scored the same as that in the ERS report: but labeled
"child food insecure with hunger (5-8)."

**WIC**

Responses to questions about the duration of receipt of WIC benefits for
children (FSQ.655) were categorized into ≤ 6, 7-12, 13-18, 19-24, 25-30,
31-36, and ≥ 37 months. Durations that appeared to be mis-entered (e.g. in
years rather than months) were edited. When children's ages and length of WIC
benefits were in different categories, the data were coded as missing. Because
of a programming error, data were not collected on all 5 year old children,
although they may have received WIC benefits in the past 12 months and thus
WIC participation for 5 year olds should not be considered complete.

**Food Stamps**

Computer programming errors resulted in some missing data on how many months
each person was authorized to receive food stamps, and whether the person was
currently authorized. These data could not be imputed and remain missing. A
household level variable was created containing the number of people in the
household receiving food stamps. This can be used in conjunction with the
variable for the total number of people in the household to calculate the
percentage of household members receiving food stamps.

## Analytic Notes

**Notes on Data Collection, Data Release, and Data Analysis**

The implementation of the Food Security Survey Module in NHANES was not always
identical to its implementation in the CPS due to a programming error. For
some participants, the items used for screening into the children's questions
(FSQ.110, 120, 140, 145) were the more severe adult questions (FSQ.070, 080,
and 090) rather than the less severe ones used in the CPS (FSQ.030f, 040, 060,
070, 080). Thus, some participants who should have been asked these questions
were not. No responses could be imputed for these items so these data are
missing. **Consequently, households that were fully food secure are over-
represented in the sample with valid data at the household, adult, and child
level and should not be used for prevalence estimates.**

Some responses to a question about emergency food use were considered invalid.
Interviewers reported that people misunderstood the phrase "eat in a community
kitchen" to include eating at a community senior center or other type of
community center, not one specifically for people without food, more commonly
called a "soup kitchen." Analyses of the data confirmed numerous positive
responses to the question by people who reported no food problems in earlier
questions. Therefore, these data are not released.

When a screening procedure within the Food Security Survey Module did not work
correctly, but data could be used to impute "presumed negative" responses,
this was done. However data could not be generated for respondents who should
have been asked a series of questions but weren't. In these cases, the FSSM
measures are coded as missing.

Categorical variables for household, adult, and child food security scales
have been constructed and are released. Because of confidentiality concerns,
data from the FSSM are not released as responses to specific items nor as
scale values. Responses to questions about duration of receipt of WIC benefits
for a mother for her last pregnancy and for a child sometimes exceeded the
length allowed (pregnancy plus one year if lactating for a mother, 5 years for
a child). Interviewers believe that mothers may not be able to distinguish
well between their food and their child's food, and that they sometimes
receive food continuously because of consecutive pregnancies. Reasons for
child errors may also be confusion of one child's benefits with another's, or
mistaken entry. NCHS staff did not edit the length of use data for women but
the data were categorized.

Errors occurred in the collection of details about food stamp receipt. Data
are complete on receipt by 1) anyone in a household and 2) each individual
household member, however follow-up details are not available for some
individuals.

In data analysis and interpretation, it is important to take account of the
level at which the data were collected and are released. Individual mother and
child WIC data and individual level food stamp data are released on an
individual participant's record only. However, the household level WIC
variable and food stamp variable, and the three food security scales
(household, adult, and child) are all released on the record of every
individual in the household. These variables do not necessarily reflect the
status of any one individual unless that person is the only child, adult, or
person in the household. **Thus, it would not be appropriate to use the FSSM
data, for example, to estimate the prevalence of children or adults
experiencing hunger in the US.** Further, because of some errors in the FSSM
data collection and the relatively small sample size, the Current Population
Survey (CPS) data are more appropriate for estimating the number of children
or adults living in households that are classified as experiencing hunger. The
NHANES data are best suited for analyses which examine household food security
in relation to health and nutritional status. Similarly, the small sample size
for food stamp data make them best suited for analyses of association rather
than prevalence estimates.
