### Lower Extremity Disease - Peripheral Neuropathy (LEXPN)

####  Data File: LEXPN.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2002

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Lower Extremity Disease Examination data will be used to determine the
prevalence of lower extremity disease in the U.S. population (diagnosed and
undiagnosed), including those at high risk for the late complications of the
disease (i.e., ulceration and amputation). The major manifestations of lower
extremity disease are peripheral vascular disease and peripheral neuropathy.
The Ankle Brachial Blood Pressure Index (ABPI) section of the Lower Extremity
Disease component collects data on peripheral vascular disease and the
Peripheral Neuropathy (LEXPN) section of the Lower Extremity Disease component
collects data on peripheral neuropathy. The following documentation provides
information on the LEXPN section.

## Component Description

Participants 40 years of age and older are asked to participate in the PN
Section of the Lower Extremity Disease examination.

**Exclusion Criteria**

Persons are excluded from the exam if they have bilateral amputations or weigh
over 400 pounds (due to equipment limitations). The variables (SEQ040, SEQ050,
WHQ020L) that record this information are found in the SEQ (Shared Exclusions)
File. In addition to these exclusion criteria, some persons who were eligible
for the exam (40 years of age and older) might not have received the exam due
to the following multiple reasons: 1) casts, ulcers, dressings, or other
conditions of the participant interfered with testing, 2) participant could
not understand the test instructions, 3) participant became ill and the test
could not be performed, 4) there was an equipment failure, 5) participant
refused, 6) participant came late or left early from the MEC and the LED exam
could not be performed, or 7) some other reason. As a result, these eligible
persons will have missing data for the PN variables.

## Protocol and Procedure

**Examination Protocol**

Participants lie supine on the exam table during the exam. Health technicians
use a standard monofilament (5.07 Semmes-Weinstein nylon monofilament mounted
on a plastic handle; Delivers approximately a 10-gram filament force) to apply
slight pressure to the bottom of each of the participantâs feet at the
following 3 sites: 1) plantar-first metatarsal head, 2) plantar-fifth
metatarsal head, and 3) plantar-hallux. The sites are tested in a
nonsequential order to allow for better discrimination of sensation by the
examinee.

Health technicians read the following standard script (English version) to the
participant prior to application of the monofilament:

> _
>
> âI want to test the sensation or sense of touch on the bottom of your
> feet. To do this test, I will use this small filament to apply pressure to
> different spots on your foot. It is not sharp and will not break the skin.
> â
>
> âAs I apply the pressure I will be saying âA, Bâ and I will be
> applying the pressure either as I am saying âAâ or as I am saying
> âBâ. I want you to tell me whether you felt the pressure when I said
> âAâ or when I said âBâ. Let me demonstrate on your arm.â
>
> âDo you understand?â
>
> _

This method presents the examinee with a choice between an interval of
stimulus from the monofilament and a second interval of background with no
stimulus. The choice is to identify in which interval the stimulus occurred,
not whether or not it occurred. The computer randomly generates the interval
in which the stimulus is applied.

If the first response at any site is correct, the test is not repeated at that
site. If the examinee cannot correctly identify the interval in which the
stimulus was applied (incorrect or âunable to determineâ response), the
test is repeated at that site up to two times until a total of two similar
responses are obtained (incorrect and âunable to determineâ are considered
similar responses).

The feet are also examined for the presence of amputations, lesions, and
bunions.  
Refer to Lower Extremity Disease Procedures Manual for further details.

**Staff**

A trained health technician performed the examination.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Inspection, calibration, and maintenance of the equipment and supplies were
performed on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Health technicians were
regularly monitored by MEC supervisory staff and observed by outside staff two
to four times per year. Data were also routinely examined by outside staff.
For further details refer to the Quality Control Manual.

## Analytic Notes

In addition to missing data for persons excluded from the exam there may be
other missing data for some persons due to one of the many reasons described
above under 'exclusion criteria' such as participant refusal, equipment
failure, or technical error.

For the monofilament testing, the participant can give a correct, incorrect,
or 'unable to determine' response. 'Could not obtain' can be entered by a
health technician if they were unable to test the site either because of
technician error or some physical limitation of the examinee (e.g., lesions,
calluses, bandages, etc. on the test site). A response of 'Could not obtain'
at any of the 3 sites on a foot does not provide any information about the
sensation at that site.

_Calculation of number of insensate areas for variables LEARPN and LEALPN:_

Nine variables go into the calculation of each variable (up to 3 tests at each
of 3 sites).

Each of the 3 sites is first defined as sensate or insensate.

_**Sensate**_ : A site is defined as sensate if

  1. the first response at a site by a participant is correct or 
  2. two out of three tests at a site yield a correct response. 

_**Insensate**_ : A site is considered insensate if there are

  1. two incorrect responses, 
  2. two 'unable to determine' responses, or 
  3. 1 incorrect and 1 'unable to determine' response for a site. 

After each of the 3 sites is defined as sensate or insensate, then the total
number of insensate sites is computed for each foot (0-3 insensate areas). If
all 3 sites on a foot are sensate then there are 'no insensate areas' and a
value of 0 (zero) is recorded. If all 3 sites have a "could not obtain (CNO)"
then there is insufficient information to calculate the number of insensate
areas and the recorded value for number of insensate areas will equal -1, not
enough information collected. Additionally, even if 1 site gets a CNO and the
other 2 are correct or incorrect/unable to determine, the overall value for
number of insensate areas will still be -1. Missing data at all 3 sites can
also yield a -1.
