### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA - Vaginal Swab: Roche Linear Array
(HPVSWR_I)

####  Data File: HPVSWR_I.xpt

##### First Published: November 2018

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexually
transmitted infections in the United States. Cervical infection with certain
types of HPV is a major risk factor for cervical cancer in women. The "high-
risk" types of HPV (e.g., HPV 16, 18) are associated with cervical cancer as
well as other anogenital cancers, and the "low-risk" types of HPV (e.g., HPV
6, 11) are associated with genital warts. No national surveillance system
exists to measure the full burden of HPV infection, and no reliable national
population estimate of HPV exists. NHANES offers a unique opportunity to
assess the prevalence of HPV infection in the general population.

Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Developmental Healthy People
2010 objective: "Reducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the
overall number of cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer
in females..." Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs will allow
evaluation of trends in prevalence of type-specific HPV infection by age,
sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity. Three HPV vaccines (Gardasil, Gardasil 9,
and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use in females. Two vaccines
are licensed and recommended for use in males (Gardasil and Gardasil 9). In
mid-2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunizations (ACIP) recommended routine
vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and for those 13-26 years not
previously vaccinated. In December 2011, ACIP recommended routine vaccination
of males aged 11 or 12 years and for those aged 13 through 21 years not
previously vaccinated. As a vaccine becomes more widely used, the national
prevalence of HPV infection will be critical for evaluating vaccination
strategies in the United States.

## Eligible Sample

Examined female participants aged 14-59 years were eligible. This public data
file includes data for examined participants aged 18 to 59 years. Please see
_Analytic Notes_ about the release of data for adolescents aged 14-17 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This assay used the Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping test that is based on
HPV L1 consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with biotinylated PGMY09/11
primer sets. It also includes biotinylated β-globin primers as an internal
control for sample amplification. The primer mix amplified essentially all HPV
types found in the genital tract along with the human β-globin gene. After
amplification, the samples were typed by hybridization to the typing strips
followed by colorimetric detection. The strip is a linear array of probes
specific for 37 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51,
52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81,
82, 83, 84, 89, and IS39) and for the positive β-globin control as well. Types
were read by comparing the reaction pattern to the typing template. Samples
that were negative for HPV and the β-globin control indicated lack of a
suitable sample and were considered inadequate for interpretation (Linear
Array HPV Genotyping Test Application manual, 2008). Refer to the Laboratory
Method Files section for a detailed description of the laboratory methods
used.

[HPV Vaginal Swab Linear Array Laboratory Procedure Manual

(November 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Vaginal swab samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Chronic Viral
Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology,
National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Swabs were stored at room temperature until they were shipped to the National
Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases for testing.

Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

** _Note: In the 2015-2016 cycle, Cobas HPV Swab High-Risk results (LBXHP2C)
are being released separately in two new datasets: HPVSWC_I and HPVC_I_R. In
the 2013-2014 cycle, LBXHP2C results were released with the Roche Linear Array
results in datasets HPVSWR_H and HPVS_H_R._**

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Sample Weights**

MEC exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data, health indicators,
and other related information collected during household interviews. Certain
sensitive data on participants under 18 years of age (e.g., HPV typing
results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files.
These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines.

The public release data file includes HPV vaginal swab data for participants
aged 18-59. HPV vaginal swab data for youth aged 14-17 years are available
through the [NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

**HPV Summary Variable**

The HPV PCR Summary variable (LBDRPCR) indicates if at least one type is
positive (LBDRPCR=1); the sample is negative (LBDRPCR=2); the sample is
inadequate (LBDRPCR=3); or the sample is missing (LBDRPCR=.).

If beta-globin is not present, both LBDRHP and LBDRLP are negative in the
sample and no HPV type is detected, the sample is coded as "Inadequate".

If any of the types on the strips (LBDR06-LBDRPI) are positive, the sample is
coded as positive. If all of the types on the strip are coded as negative, and
beta-globin is detected (either LBDRHP or LBDRLP is positive) the sample is
coded as negative.

Variables LBDRHP through LBDRPI are from the RUO Roche Linear Array HPV typing
assay, however LBDR52 also includes information from a type-specific assay for
HPV 52. The Linear Array typing strip includes an XR probe that hybridizes
with HPV 52 as well as HPV types 33, 35 and 58. Samples positive for the XR
probe and 33, 35, or 58 require specific testing to confirm the presence of
HPV 52 (Onyekwuluje et al., 2012).

**Detection Limits**

If data is qualitative, the use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
