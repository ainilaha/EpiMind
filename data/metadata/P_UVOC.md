### Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Metabolites - Urine (P_UVOC)

####  Data File: P_UVOC.xpt

##### First Published: September 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is ubiquitous. Chronic exposure
to extremely high levels of some VOCs can lead to cancer and neurocognitive
dysfunction. Urinary metabolites of VOCs can be detectable in urine for a
longer period of time than the parent VOCs can be detected in blood.

Nearly 200 air toxicants have been associated with adverse health effects in
occupational studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in
general population groups. Information on levels of exposure to these
compounds, as measured by their metabolite levels in urine, is essential to
determine the need for regulatory mechanisms to reduce the levels of hazardous
air pollutants to which the general population is exposed.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and participants aged 6 years and
older from a one-third subsample in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure for the measurement of VOC metabolites
in human urine using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with
electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI/MSMS) as described by Alwis et
al., (2012). Chromatographic separation is achieved using an Acquity UPLC® HSS
T3 (Part no. 186003540, 1.8 µm x 2.1 mm x 150 mm, Waters Inc.) column with 15
mM ammonium acetate and acetonitrile as the mobile phases. The eluent from the
column is ionized using an electrospray interface to generate and transmit
negative ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative response
factors (ratio of native analyte to stable isotope labeled internal standard)
with known standard concentrations yields individual analyte concentrations.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals
(LPMs). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until
they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the CDC and contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include
performing blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In
addition, contract laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all
specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Variable (WTSAPRP) encoding of the specific sample weights for this
subsample is included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data. These special sample weights were created to account for the
subsample selection probability, as well as the additional nonresponse to
these lab tests. Therefore, if participants were eligible for the subsample,
but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the sample weight value
assigned as "0" in their records.  
  
**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017- March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  
  
This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDAAMLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDAAMLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXAAM) provides the
analytic result for the analyte. All data are rounded to three significant
figures or three decimal places, whichever is less precise.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for urinary VOC metabolites:
