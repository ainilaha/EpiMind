### Pesticide Use (PUQMEC_D)

####  Data File: PUQMEC_D.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2007

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Pesticide Use section (variable name prefix PUQ) provides survey
participant level interview data on pesticide use in the home and lawn or
garden during the past 7 days.

## Eligible Sample

The questions in this section were asked of proxy respondents for children 6
and 7 years of age; respondents 8 years of age and older answered for
themselves.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questionnaire was done during the physical examination, at the mobile
examination center (MEC), in the MEC Interview Room, using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interviewing-CAPI (interviewer administered) system, for
study participants 12 and older. This questionnaire was done by a dietary
interviewer, during the dietary recall interview, at the examination center,
for study participants 6 - 7 years old (proxy interview).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

All of the data were reviewed by the NHANES field office staff for accuracy
and completeness.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed and edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical
values.

## Analytic Notes

Beginning in 2005 the Pesticide Use section (variable name prefix PUQ) was
administered in the MEC interview for all participants aged 8 years and older.
These questions were asked of proxy respondents for children 6 and 7 years in
the Dietary Recall. Two questions on pesticide use in the home and lawn or
garden during the past 7 days were administered.

From 1999-2004 the Pesticide Use section (variable name prefix PUQ) was
collected at family level interview. Six questions on pesticide use in the
home and private yard during the past month were administered. One study
participant in each family responded for the entire family and these responses
were released for all members of the same family. All questions in this
section were asked of all families.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines on the NHANES website for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic
Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
