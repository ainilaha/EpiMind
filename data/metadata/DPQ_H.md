### Mental Health - Depression Screener (DPQ_H)

####  Data File: DPQ_H.xpt

#####  First Published: March 2016

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

A nine-item depression screening instrument, the Patient Health Questionnaire
(Kroenke and Spitzer, 2002; Kroenke et al., 2001) was administered to
determine the frequency of depression symptoms over the past 2 weeks. A
follow-up question assessed the overall impairment of the symptoms. Response
categories for the nine-item instrument "not at all," "several days," "more
than half the days," and "nearly every day" were given a point ranging from 0
to 3. The instrument incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria
(Spitzer et al.1999). The variable prefix is DPQ.

## Eligible Sample

Mobile Examination Center (MEC) participants 12 years and older were eligible.
Only data from participants aged 18 and older are included in this data file.
Participants requiring a proxy were not eligible because of the sensitive
nature of the questions.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The questions were asked at the MEC, by trained interviewers, using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system as part of the MEC
interview. Proxy respondents were not permitted for this section.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure completeness, consistency and analytic usefulness of
the data.

## Analytic Notes

A total score is based on the sum of the points in each item ranging from 0 to
27. Major depression and depression severity can be assessed using pre-defined
cut-points References).

Data for youth aged 12-17 years are available through the NCHS Research Data
Center only.

The NHANES full sample 2-Year MEC Exam Weights (WTMEC2YR) should be used to
analyze the 2013-2014.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
