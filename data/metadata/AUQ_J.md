# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2017-2018 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Audiometry (AUQ_J)

####  Data File: AUQ_J.xpt

##### First Published: July 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Audiometry questionnaire section (variable name prefix AUQ) provides
interview data on self-reported hearing status, tinnitus (ringing in the
ears), hearing screening history, the use of hearing aids, the use of
assistive devices for hearing, and risk factors for hearing loss.

Topics included in this section are:

  * Self-assessed condition of hearing; 
  * The Gallaudet hearing scale for self-reported hearing loss; 
  * Impact of hearing ability on daily life; 
  * Onset and cause of any self-reported hearing trouble; 
  * History of ear infections; ear tube placed for infection; 
  * History of speech-language or special education services; 
  * How recently hearing tests were performed, if ever; 
  * Hearing aid use and cochlear implant status; 
  * Use of assistive listening devices; 
  * 12-month period prevalence of tinnitus: how long bothered by tinnitus, tinnitus present after loud sounds, bothered by tinnitus when falling asleep, self-assessed severity of tinnitus; 
  * History of exposure to firearms noise, occupational and/or non-occupational loud noise; and 
  * Data on hearing protection use. 

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants, aged 1 year and older, were eligible for the initial
question (AUQ054) relating to self-reported hearing capability/deficits. The
rest of the questions in this section were only for participants aged 6-19 and
70 years and older.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Hand cards showing
response categories were also used for some questions. When necessary, the
interviewers read the hand cards to respondents. Persons 16 years of age and
older and emancipated minors were interviewed directly. A proxy provided
information for survey participants who were under 16 years of age and for
participants whom could not answer the questions themselves.

The [Interviewer Procedure
Manuals](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_Interviewer_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and [Survey
Questionnaires](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/questionnaires/AUQ_J.pdf)
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The 2017-2018 data were reviewed, frequency counts were checked, "skip"
patterns were verified, and the reasonableness of question responses was
reviewed.

## Analytic Notes

Full sample NHANES 2017-2018 Interview weights should be used if statistical
analysis only involves the NHANES questionnaire data. Although these data were
collected as a part of the household questionnaire, if they are merged with
MEC examination data (for example the Audiometry examination or laboratory
data), exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the
[NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

When combining AUQ data from different survey cycles, please note that there
are some modifications in questions between survey cycles. The age range for
this questionnaire changed for the 2017-2018 cycle. Except for question
AUQ054, which was asked of every participant 1+ years, the age range was 6-19
and 70+ years. See Appendix I for more details on the changes in the AUQ
section from 1999 to 2018.

Previous National Health Interview Survey Audiometry questionnaires served as
questionnaire sources (NHIS,2007; Ries,1982). Other related datasets,
including Audiometry, Tympanometry, Wideband Absorbance, and Acoustic Reflex
examination data for NHANES participants is available in the Audiometry
section of the NHANES 2017-2018 Examination data files.
