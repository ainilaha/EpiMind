### Arsenics - Speciated - Urine (UAS_J)

####  Data File: UAS_J.xpt

##### First Published: July 2021

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Arsenic is widely distributed in the earth's crust and is found most often in
ground water rather than surface water. People encounter arsenic in many
chemical forms that vary greatly in toxicity. The most toxic of the naturally
occurring arsenic compounds are inorganic forms of arsenic and their
methylated metabolites (ATSDR, 2007). Less toxic are the organic arsenic
compounds (ATSDR, 2007). Exposure to inorganic arsenic can result in a variety
of adverse health effects, such as skin disorders, nerve impairment, cancer of
the liver, bladder, kidneys, prostate, and lungs, and even death from large
doses (ATSDR, 2007). Organic arsenic compounds are generally less toxic and
may be encountered by ingesting various types of fish, shellfish, or seaweed
(Brown et al., 1990).

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Arsenobetaine, arsenocholine,  monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid,
arsenous (III) acid, arsenic (V) acid **

The concentration of speciated arsenics is determined by using high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate the species coupled to an
ICP-DRC-MS to detect the arsenic species. This analytical technique is based
on separation by anion-exchange chromatography (IC), followed by detection
using quadrupole ICP-MS technology, and includes DRC™ technology (Baranov VI
et al., 1999), which minimizes or eliminates many argon-based polyatomic
interferences (Tanner S et al., 2000), will require 0.5 mL of urine. Arsenic
species column separation is largely achieved due to differences in charge-
charge interactions of each negatively charged arsenic component in the mobile
phase, with the positively charged quaternary ammonium groups bound at the
column's solid-liquid interface. Upon exit from the column, the
chromatographic eluent goes through a nebulizer, where it is converted into an
aerosol upon entering the spray chamber.

Carried by a stream of argon gas, a portion of the aerosol is transported
through the spray chamber and then through the central channel of the plasma,
where it is heated to temperatures of 6000-8000° K. This thermal energy
atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating
at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer,
which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr.

The mass spectrometer permits detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio
in rapid sequence, which allows the determination of individual isotopes of an
element. Once inside the mass spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion
optics, then through the DRC™, and finally through the mass-analyzing
quadrupole before being detected as they strike the surface of the detector.
The ion optics uses an electrical field to focus the ion beam into the DRC™.

The DRC™ component is pressurized with an appropriate reaction gas and
contains a quadrupole. In the DRC™, elimination or reduction of argon-based
polyatomic interferences takes place through the interaction of the reaction
gas with the interfering polyatomic species in the incoming ion beam. The
quadrupole in the DRC™ allows elimination of unwanted reaction by-products
that would otherwise react to form new interferences.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Arsenics - Speciated - Urine Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/UAS-J-
MET-508.pdf) (August 2021)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et
al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Variable (WTSA2YR) encoding of the specific sample weights for this
subsample is included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data. These special sample weights were created to account for the
subsample selection probability, as well as the additional nonresponse to
these lab tests. Therefore, if participants were eligible for the subsample,
but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the sample weight value
assigned as "0" in their records.  
  
**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017-2018 Demographics
File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.  
  
This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
Albumin & Creatinine - Urine.

  
**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDUABLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUAB) provides the analytic
result for that analyte.  For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., URDUABLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]).  
  
The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for the speciated arsenics are:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URXUAS3 |  Urinary Arsenous Acid |  0.12  
URXUAS5 |  Urinary Arsenic acid |  0.79  
URXUAB |  Urinary Arsenobetaine |  1.16  
URXUAC |  Urinary Arsenocholine |  0.11  
URXUDMA |  Urinary Dimethylarsinic Acid |  1.91  
URXUMMA |  Urinary Monomethylarsonic Acid |  0.20
