## Eligible Sample

The target samples for questions in this section vary by age and gender.
Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency counts were
verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked before the physical examination, in the home, using
the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing-CAPI (interviewer administered)
system.

The survey questionnaire can be found at the NHANES website.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed and edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical
values.

## Analytic Notes

A number of additional questions occur in MCQ that are logically related to
other questionnaire sections or exam segments. Analysts should refer to these
other NHANES sections as part of any data analysis.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic Guidelines are
available on the NHANES website.
