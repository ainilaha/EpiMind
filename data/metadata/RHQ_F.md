# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2009-2010 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Reproductive Health (RHQ_F)

####  Data File: RHQ_F.xpt

##### First Published: September 2011

##### Last Revised: December 2017

## Component Description

This section contains questions for females only, on reproductive health,
including menstrual history, pregnancy history, lactation, oral contraceptive
and hormone replacement therapy use and other related conditions.

## Eligible Sample

Female mobile examination participants, 12 years and older, were eligible.
However, select variables related to pregnancy have been excluded from this
data file for those ages 12-19 years and over 44 years due to disclosure
risks. (Refer to the Analytic Notes for more details.)

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were administered at the mobile examination center, by trained
interviewers, using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system
as part of the Mobile Examination Center (MEC) interview. Both proxy
interviewers and interpreters were permitted for these questions.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.  
  
Approximately 5% of the interviews were recorded and reviewed for quality
control purposes.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure the completeness, consistency and analytic
usefulness of the data.

## Analytic Notes

This data file contains complete records for variables related to pregnancy
for females 20 - 44 years of age. Due to disclosure concerns, the following
pregnancy related variables have been excluded from this data file for 12-19
year olds: RHD042, RHQ131, RHD143, RHD152, RHQ160, RHQ162, RHQ163, RHQ166,
RHQ169, RHQ171, RHQ172, RHD173, RHD180, RHD190, RHQ197, RHQ200, and RHQ205.
Information related to current pregnancyis also unavailable for females 45 and
older. Please note that these exclusions were made only in the 2009-2010 and
2007-2008 data releases but not in earlier releases of the RHQ data files.
Analysts wishing to combine data for multiple years should pay careful
attention to these changes. The complete data file containing all variables
for females 12 years and older (RHQ_F_R) is available through the NCHS
Research Data Center.  
  
Due to sample design changes starting in 2007, pregnant women and individuals
12-19 were no longer oversampled. Additionally, for each of the race/ethnicity
domains, the former 12-15 and 16-19 year age domains were combined and the
40-59 year age minority domains were split into two 10-year age sampling
domains: 40-49 and 50-59. These changes result in an increase in the actual
number of participants 40-59 years and a decrease in 12-19 year olds, as
compared to previous cycles. Therefore, unweighted frequencies of certain
reproductive conditions may differ slightly in this survey cycle compared to
survey cycles prior to 2007. For further discussion, please see the [NHANES
2009 - 2010 Public Data General Release File
Documentation](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2009),
available on the NHANES website at:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2009>  
  
Notes for specific variables:  
RHD143: Current pregnancy by self-report is collected primarily to determine
appropriate question skip patterns according to various reproductive
conditions in this section. However, analysts are strongly advised to use the
all inclusive pregnancy variable RIDEXPREG, found in the Demographic data
file, for all analyses where the determination of pregnancy status is
necessary. RIDEXPREG includes both self-reported and the results of the urine
pregnancy test.  
  
MEC exam sample weights should be used for the analyses.  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
