### Acrylamide & Glycidamide (AMDGYD_D)

####  Data File: AMDGYD_D.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2016

#####  Last Revised: October 2016

## Component Description

Acrylamide, a toxic and potentially cancer-causing chemical, is formed in high
amounts in many types of food prepared/cooked at high temperatures. Acrylamide
is formed during the cooking process, specifically when preparing french
fries, potato chips and other fried products. Intake of acrylamide through the
consumption of these foods can be high, thus exposing a large portion of the
population to this chemical and putting them at risk of adverse health
effects. Although acrylamide is known to cause adverse health effects, despite
the existence of biomarkers to assess exposure to this chemical, limited data
on the actual acrylamide exposure in the population exists. Filling this
knowledge gap is especially important to properly assess the risks associated
with the consumption of food containing high levels of acrylamide.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 3 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This procedure describes a method to measure hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide
and its primary metabolite glycidamide in human whole blood or erythrocytes.
Specifically, the reaction products with the N-terminal valine of the
hemoglobin protein chains (N-[2-carbamoylethyl]valine and
N-[2-hydroxycarbamoyl-ethyl]valine for acrylamide and glycidamide adducts,
respectively) are measured.

This method is based on modified Edman reaction, which uses the effect of
N-alkylated amino acids being able to form Edman products in neutral or
alkaline conditions without changing the pH to acidic conditions required in
conventional Edman reaction procedures. It was first described for N-terminal
hemoglobin adducts of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and styrene oxide and
later optimized to increase yield of Edman products of these adducts. This
optimized method was then successfully applied to adducts produced by other
chemicals such as acrylamide, glycidamide and acrylonitrile. This optimized
method was further refined and modified in-house to increase sensitivity and
enable automation.

The procedure described here consists of 4 parts:

  1. Preparation of the specimen for measurement of hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide and glycidamide; 
  2. Total hemoglobin measurement in the sample solution used for hemoglobin adduct measurements; 
  3. Modified Edman reaction in the sample solution and isolation of Edman products and 
  4. Analysis of Edman products by HPLC/MS/MS and results processing 



Because results are reported in pmol adduct per gram of hemoglobin, the amount
of hemoglobin used for the modified Edman reaction needs to be known.
Therefore, this procedure includes a measurement procedure for total
hemoglobin. It is a commercial assay kit based on a well-established procedure
commonly used in clinical chemistry.

Quantitation of the acrylamide and glycidamide hemoglobin adduct is performed
using octapeptides with the same amino acid sequence as the N-terminal of the
beta-chain of hemoglobin and with acrylamide and glycidamide attached at the
valine (AA-VHLTPEEK, GA-VHLTPEEK) and the corresponding stable isotope labeled
AA-Val(13C5 15N)-HLTPEEK and GA-Val(13C5 15N)-HLTPEEK as internal standards.
Total hemoglobin measurement is performed using calibrators provided with the
manufacture's assay kit.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Packed red cells are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf). Vials
are stored under appropriate frozen (-70°C) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

**Acrylamide and Glycidamide Data for 2005-2006  
**Measurements performed in this NHANES cycle were performed in isolated and
washed red blood cells, which were prepared from EDTA-whole blood immediately
after specimen collection. Measurements performed in the NHANES 2003-2004
cycle were conducted using frozen, stored whole blood. No information is
available about the potential effect of these different specimen treatment and
storage conditions on measurement results. These differences may need to be
considered when comparing results from this NHANES cycle with those obtained
from NHANES 2003-2004.

Refer to the [2005-2006 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2005)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES 2005-2006 Demographics
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2005-2006/FASTQX_D.XPT) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**  
The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
ended "LC" (ex., LBDACRLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
LBDACRLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXACR) provides the
analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in pmol/g) for acrylamide and glycidamide
is:

**Variable Name  ** | **  SAS Label** | **  LLOD**  
---|---|---  
 LBXACR |  Acrylamide (pmol/G Hb) |  3.00  
 LBXGLY |  Glycidamide (pmol/G Hb) |  4.00  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
