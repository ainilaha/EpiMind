### Mercury: Inorganic - Urine (UHG_H)

####  Data File: UHG_H.xpt

##### First Published: January 2016

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Mercury is widespread in the environment and originates from natural and
anthropogenic sources. The general population may be exposed to three forms of
mercury: elemental, inorganic, or organic (primarily methyl mercury). The
concentration of total mercury in urine is a bio-measure of exposure primarily
to elemental and inorganic mercury, although some mercury in urine comes from
de-methylation of methyl mercury in blood (Abe et al, 1995). Elemental and
inorganic mercury exposure can result from mercury spills, dental amalgams,
and occupational exposures. Both elemental and inorganic mercury are
nephrotoxic and neurotoxic. Health effects related to low exposure in the
general population are not well defined. In the 1999-2002 cycle NHANES, urine
mercury levels were measured in all women aged 16-49 years. From 2003-2004
cycle forward, urine mercury levels were measured in a one-third subsample of
participants aged 6 years and older.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method directly measures the mercury content of urine specimens using
mass spectrometry after a simple dilution sample preparation step. Liquid
samples are introduced into the mass spectrometer through the inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) ionization source, reduced to small droplets in an argon
aerosol via a nebulizer, and then the droplets enter the ICP. The ions first
pass through a focusing region, followed by the dynamic reaction cell (DRC),
the quadrupole mass filter, and finally are selectively counted in rapid
sequence at the detector, allowing individual isotopes of an element to be
determined.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-70Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary mercury was measured in a one-third subsample of persons 6 years and
older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The recommended procedure for variance
estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU,
respectively) in the [Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013).

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit was constant for the analyte in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDUHGLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
URDUHGLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUHG) provides the
analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for urinary mercury is:

**Analyte** | **Item ID** | **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
Urinary mercury | URXUHG | 0.13  
  
Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
