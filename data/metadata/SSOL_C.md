### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (Surplus)
(SSOL_C)

####  Data File: SSOL_C.xpt

##### First Published: August 2012

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at
serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

Conduct serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation analyses, and kappa and
lambda free light chain (FLC) assays in serum, to determine the age-adjusted
prevalence and monoclonal protein size distribution of MGUS by ethnic/racial
group. Using our results from applied serum analyses, in combination with
available information from the NHANES surveys (such as data from medical
exams; routine blood samples; questionnaires covering medical history, drug
intake, nutrition, smoking, and demographics), we will be able to dissect
etiologic mechanisms involved in MGUS development and transformation to full-
blown multiple myeloma.

Because the mucosal immune system is a a major site of extrinsic immune
stimuation, and celiac disease is associated with a potent stimulation of the
gut immune system, elaborating both T cell and B cell mediated immune
responses, typically associated with an increase in expansion of B cells and
plasma cells within the gut the assays also include serologic testing for
celiac disease. Immune responses in celiac disease include both IgA and IgG
and possibly IgM responses. Celiac disease may affect as many as 1% of the
population but most remain undiagnosed. Celiac disease has also occasionally
been reported in association with multiple myeloma. Using the celiac assays we
are evaluating if there is any correlation between seropositivity for celiac
disease and markers for plasma protein abnormalities.

## Eligible Sample

Participants ≥ 50 years of age from NHANES 2003-2004.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Measurement of Serum Protein Markers**

 A total of 250 microliter of serum was used for each study subject to perform
the analyses to detect and quantify M protein and FLC (described below). For
those individuals where an abnormal protein band or equivocal pattern with
conventional agarose-gel electrophoresis was found, an additional 250
microliter serum was used to perform immunofixation for validation purposes
(see below).

**Electrophoresis**

First, serum samples were analyzed for all identified subjects (described
above) by using conventional agarose-gel electrophoresis, which has been
described in detail previously. This revealed the occurrence and pattern
(including determination of the size) of M proteins in the study cohort. If
there was an abnormal band or equivocal pattern, immunofixation was performed
to validate and to specify type of M protein.

**Free light chains**

FLC levels were determined in all positive study samples (described above)
using the FLC assay (Freelite; The Binding Site, Birmingham, United Kingdom)
performed on a Dade-Behring Nephelometer (Deerfield, IL). It consists of two
separate measurements, one to detect free-kappa (normal range, 3.3-19.4 mg/L)
and the other to detect free-lambda (normal range, 5.7-26.3 mg/L) light
chains. In addition to measuring the absolute levels of FLC, the test also
allows the assessment of clonality based on the ratio of kappa-lambda light
chain levels (normal reference range, 0.26-1.65). Subjects with a kappa-lambda
FLC ratio less than 0.26 are typically defined as having monoclonal lambda FLC
and those with ratios greater than 1.65 are defined as having a monoclonal
kappa FLC. If the FLC ratio is greater than 1.65, kappa is considered to be
the "involved" FLC and lambda the "uninvolved" FLC, and vice versa if the
ratio is less than 0.26. The normal reference range of 0.26 to 1.65 for the
free-kappa-lambda ratio in the FLC assay reflects a higher serum level of
free-lambda light chains than would be expected given the usual kappa-lambda
ratio of two intact immuno¬globulins. This occurs because the renal excretion
of free kappa (which exists usually in a monomeric state) is much faster than
free lambda (which is usually in a dimeric state).

**Celiac assays**

Testing consists of a sequential test strategy, which has proven both
sensitive and specific for establishing a serologic diagnosis of celiac
disease. The first level test consists of a tissue transglutaminase IgA ELISA
test and, for patients who's test exceeds the normal range, a confirmatory
test with endomysial antibody by immunofluorescence is then carried out.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

All protein analyses in this study will be performed at the Protein Immunology
Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. The Protein Immunology
Laboratory is the leading laboratory in the world with regard to protein
studies on MGUS and multiple myeloma. Since the early 1960's Mayo Clinic have
published extensively in this field. In order to assess accuracy and precision
before study start, we performed quality control (QC) analyses of serum from 2
positive MGUS subjects (known to have MGUS), 2 negative MGUS subject (known
not to have MGUS), 2 positive FLC subjects (known to have FLC), and 2 negative
FLC subject (known not to have FLC). Briefly, for each of these six QC
individuals, we aliquoted serum into 5 tubes at an NCI laboratory and
thereafter sent the serum in blinded tubes to the Protein Immunology
Laboratory at Mayo Clinic for analyses of M protein and FLC, respectively. The
results were very stable.

In terms of sample storage and potential influence on results; the Mayo Clinic
lab has analyzed over 1,100 sera collected up to 35 years before testing,
without any problems to perform the assays. The practice in the laboratory is
to repeat the assay following a variety of storage activities. For example,
serum is stored at room temperature for one week and the assays are repeated
on days 1, 3, 5, and 7. Also, samples are refrigerated at 0 to 4 degrees
Celsius for 7 days and then assays are repeated on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.
Further, they freeze serum sample at -20 degrees Celsius for 1 and 2 weeks,
then they thaw and run the assays. In addition, they subject samples to 3
cycles of freeze/thaw and then repeat the assays (personal communication, Dr.
Kyle, December 2006). Thus, freeze/thaw steps will not have an adverse impact
on the methods being used in our proposed study.

## Data Processing and Editing
