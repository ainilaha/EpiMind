## 2013-2014 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Osteoporosis (OSQ_H)

####  Data File: OSQ_H.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2015

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Osteoporosis section (OSQ) provides personal interview data on the
following:

  * Self-reported information regarding fractured hip, wrist, or spine; 
  * Number of times hip, wrist, or spine was fractured; 
  * Age at each hip, wrist, or spine fracture; 
  * Amount of trauma causing each hip, wrist, or spine fracture; 
  * Fractures of any other bones, amount of trauma causing the fractures, and age when the fractures occurred; 
  * Whether the participant has ever been diagnosed as having osteoporosis; 
  * If diagnosed with osteoporosis, whether the participant has been treated by prescription medicine (Fosamax, Boniva, Actonel, Reclast, Miacalcin, Fortical, Evista or Forteo);
  * Participant use of prednisone or cortisone pills; 
  * Whether either of the participant's biological parents had been diagnosed as having osteoporosis; 
  * Whether the participant's mother had ever fractured her hip, and if so, at what age; and 
  * Whether the participant's father had ever fractured his hip, and if so, at what age. 

Several of the questions in this section also were included in the NHANES III:
1988-94 questionnaires under Musculoskeletal Conditions.

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for this section is participants aged 40 and over. However,
the target sample for some questions in this section is participants aged 50
and over. Please review the codebook carefully.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

This questionnaire section was conducted, in the home, using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. Hand cards showing response
categories were used for some questions.

The [2013-2014 Interviewer Procedure
Manuals](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/intrvwr_proc_manual.pdf)
and [Exam
Manuals](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/questionnaires.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
and the Osteoporosis Sample Person Questionnaire can be found on the [NHANES
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of the file.

For details on the quality control/quality assurance process for this
component, please refer to the [NHANES 2013-14 Interviewer Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/intrvwr_proc_manual.pdf)
on the [NHANES website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Data Processing and Editing

For participants aged 80 and over, responses to OSD030a (How old were you when
you fractured your hip?), OSD030b (how old were you when you fractured your
wrist?), OSD030c (How old were you when you fractured your spine?), and OSQ110
(How old were you when you fractured (other bones) after you were 20 years of
age) were coded as 80 years. This was done to address data disclosure concerns
and to be consistent with age codes in the demographic and other sample person
files.

The following variables had empty fields and, therefore, were dropped from the
data file: OSD030AD-OSD030AJ, OSD030CD-OSD030CJ, OSD040AD-OSD040AJ, OSD040CD-
OSD040CJ, OSD050AD-OSD050AJ, OSD050CD-OSD050CJ, OSQ090I-J, OSQ100F, OSQ100H,
OSQ100I-J, OSD110F, OSD110H, OSD110I-J and OSQ120I-J.

## Analytic Notes

Since these data are collected during the household questionnaire, interview
weights should be used. However, if these data are merged with MEC exam data,
exam sample weights should be used for the analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
online [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. The Analytic
Guidelines are available on the [NHANES
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).
