### Mental Health - Depression Screener (DPQ_D)

####  Data File: DPQ_D.xpt

##### First Published: April 2008

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

These questions are from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), a version of
the Prime-MD diagnostic instrument. They are a self-reported assessment based
on the nine DSM-IV signs and symptoms for depression. Referred to as the
Depression Screener Questionnaire (DPQ) in NHANES, the nine symptom questions
are scored from "0" (not at all) to "3" (nearly every day). An additional
follow-up question assesses the overall impairment of the depressive symptoms.
Used most often in primary care settings, the PHQ has been shown to be a
reliable and valid tool for the diagnosis of depression.

## Eligible Sample

Mobile Examination Center (MEC) participants 12 years and older were eligible.
No proxies were permitted to answer these questions. Only data from
participants aged 18 years and older are included in this data file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked  by trained interviewers in Spanish or English
using the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system during the MEC
private interview.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Approximately 5% of the interviews were recorded and reviewed for quality
control purposes.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure the completeness, consistency, and analytic
usefulness of the data.

## Analytic Notes

Separate DPQ_D data files, according to age of participants, have been created
to protect the confidentiality of youths. The DPQ_D data file for youths ages
12-17 is only available through the NCHS Research Data Center.
