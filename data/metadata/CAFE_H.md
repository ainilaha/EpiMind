### Caffeine & Caffeine Metabolites - Urine (CAFE_H)

####  Data File: CAFE_H.xpt

##### First Published: June 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Caffeine is an alkaloid that is known to have psychoactive stimulatory
effects. Caffeine naturally occurs in plants (e.g., coffee beans, tea leaves,
cocoa beans, cola nuts), and the dietary consumption of caffeine originates
mainly from derivative beverages (e.g., coffee, tea, cola drinks) and foods
(e.g., chocolate). Caffeine is also used as a food additive in beverages
(e.g., caffeinated soft drinks, "energy" drinks) and as a drug either on its
own or as an adjuvant in certain medications (e.g., analgesics).

Given the high prevalence of behaviorally active caffeine doses in the
worldwide diet, significant scientific interest in the health effects of
caffeine has developed. As a psychoactive stimulant, the behavioral effects of
caffeine, such as its effect on mental alertness, have been studied
extensively, and topics such as caffeine tolerance, addiction, and withdrawal
have also been examined. Caffeine consumption has been studied as a risk
factor for many diseases and conditions, including hypertension, bone density,
cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, reproduction and developmental
abnormalities, and mental and behavioral disorders.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Caffeine and 14 of its metabolites are quantified in urine by use of high-
performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem quadrupole
mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) with stable isotope labeled internal
standards. A 50-µL aliquot of urine is first diluted with 450 µL of water.
Then, 100 µL of the diluted urine is combined with 120 µL of a 0.2 N NaOH
solution containing stable isotope labeled internal standards. The mixture is
incubated for at least 30 min at room temperature, facilitating the conversion
of an unstable uracil metabolite into a more stable form. Samples are then
acidified with 30 µL of 2.0 N HCl and 250 µL of a 1:9 methanol/water solution
containing 0.1% formic acid such that the matrix of the sample is similar to
the starting mobile phase composition of the analysis step. Samples are
filtered and analyzed by use of HPLC-ESI-MS/MS in both positive and negative
ionization modes. Quantitation is based on peak area ratios interpolated
against an 11-point calibration curve derived from calibrators in synthetic
urine.  

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component during the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Caffeine and Caffeine Metabolites - Urine Lab Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/CAFE-H-
MET-508.pdf) (June 2020)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual (LPM).
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf)Vials
were stored under the appropriate frozen (-30oC) conditions until they were
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Center (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
details on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolites were measured in a one-third
subsample of participants 6 years and over. Special sample weights are
required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.  

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables.  The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographic
File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.  The
recommended procedures for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data can be linked to the other NHANES data files using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

In the 2013-2014 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not
be reported with this file. URXUCR can be found in the 2013-2014 data file
titled "Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDMU1LC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXMU1) provides the analytic
result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., URDHU1LC = 1), an imputed fill value was placed in
the analyte result field. The value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in umol/L) for caffeine and caffeine
metabolites:
