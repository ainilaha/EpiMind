### Iodine - Urine (L06UIO_B)

####  Data File: L06UIO_B.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2004

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Trace metals have been associated with adverse health effects in occupational
studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in general
population groups. Information on levels of exposure to these compounds is
essential to determine the need for regulatory mechanisms to reduce the levels
of hazardous pollutants to which the general population is exposed and to
establish population-based reference intervals for several potentially toxic
metals.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older on a one-third sample were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a multi-element
analytical technique. Liquid samples are introduced into the ICP through a
nebulizer and spray chamber carried by a flowing argon stream. By coupling
radio-frequency power with flowing argon, plasma is created in which the
predominant species are positive argon ions and electrons. The sample passes
through a region of the plasma that has a temperature of 6000-8000 K. The
thermal energy atomizes the sample and then ionizes the atoms. The ions and
the argon enter the mass spectrometer through the interface that separates the
ICP, which operates at atmospheric pressure, from the mass spectrometer, which
operates at a pressure of 10-6 torr. The mass spectrometer permits rapid-
sequence ion detection at each mass, which allows determination of individual
isotopes of an element. Electrical signals from the ion detection are
processed into digital information that is used to first indicate the
intensity of the ions and then is used to indicate the concentration of the
element. Urine samples are diluted 1+9 with 1% (v/v) tetramethylammonium
hydroxide (TMAH) containing tellurium for internal standardization.

## Data Processing and Editing

Specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, National Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia. Detailed specimen collection
and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
Description of the Laboratory Methodology section.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

Measures of urinary iodine were assessed in participants aged 6 years and over
on a one-third sample.

The analysis of NHANES 2001-2002 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2001-2002
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such
as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and
phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Subsample Weight Notes**

Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Use the
special weights included in this data file when analyzing data.
