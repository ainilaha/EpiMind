## Component Description

**Acrylamide and Glycidamide**

Acrylamide (AA) has been identified as neurotoxic, mutagenic, and a probable
genotoxic to animals and humans (Clin Chem, 2016). It is classified as a
probable carcinogen to humans by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) and as a potential occupational carcinogen by the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). People are exposed to acrylamide
through certain occupational activities that involve the production and use of
acrylamide, such as in waste water treatment, ore processing, paper and
textile industries and manufacturing of dyes and adhesives.  AA exposure can
occur from tobacco smoke and dry-heated food. The actual exposure of the
general population to acrylamide and possible changes in this exposure over
time are not known.

Glycidamide (GA), the primary metabolite of AA, has a higher reactivity
towards nucleophilic reagents than AA. Results from animal studies suggest
that genetic damage in somatic and germ cells is dependent upon the metabolism
of AA to GA by Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E) (Clin Chem, 2016). To obtain
comprehensive information about acrylamide exposure and to assess potential
health effects related to this exposure, it is necessary to measure both AA
and GA exposures. Information on exposure to these chemicals in the general
population is needed to assess potential health effects associated with this
exposure and to monitor changes in exposure over time.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 18 years and older from a one-third subsample were
eligible. Additionally, to oversample adult smokers, those participants aged
18 years and older, not in the regular one-third subsample, who smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in their entire lifetime (SMQ020=1) and now smoke
cigarettes every day (SMQ040=1), were also included in this special subsample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This procedure describes a method to measure hemoglobin adducts of AA and its
primary metabolite GA in human whole blood or erythrocytes. Specifically, the
reaction products with the N-terminal valine of the hemoglobin protein chains
(N-[2-carbamoyl ethyl] valine and N-[2-hydroxycarbamoyl-ethyl] valine for AA
and GA, respectively) are measured.

This method is based on the modified Edman reaction, which uses the effect of
N-alkylated amino acids being able to form Edman products in neutral or
alkaline conditions without changing the pH to acidic conditions required in
conventional Edman reaction procedures. It was first described for N-terminal
hemoglobin adducts of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and styrene oxide and
later optimized to increase yield of Edman products of these adducts. This
optimized method was then successfully applied to adducts produced by other
chemicals, such as AA and GA. This optimized method was further refined and
modified in-house to increase sensitivity and enable automation.

The procedure described here consists of 4 parts:

1.    Preparation of the specimen for measurement of hemoglobin adducts of AA and GA; 

2.    Measurement of total hemoglobin in the sample solution used for hemoglobin adduct measurements; 

3.    Modified Edman reaction in the sample solution and isolation of Edman products; and 

4.    Analysis of Edman products by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and results processing. 

Because results are reported in pmol adduct per gram of hemoglobin, the amount
of hemoglobin used for the modified Edman reaction needs to be known.
Therefore, this procedure includes a measurement procedure for total
hemoglobin. It is a commercial assay kit based on a well-established procedure
commonly used in clinical chemistry. Quantitation of the AA and GA hemoglobin
adducts is performed using octapeptides with the same amino acid sequence as
the N-terminal of the beta-chain of hemoglobin with AA and GA attached at the
valine.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory method used.

This is a new component in the 2013-2014 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Acrylamide and Glycidamide Lab Procedure

(December 2019)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Washed-packed red blood cell specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to
the Division of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
[NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Acylamide and glycidamide were measured in a special smoking subsample of
persons 18 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DEMO_H.htm) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/FASTQX_H.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
ended "LC" (ex., LBDACRLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXACR) provides the analytic result for
that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBDACRLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in pmol/g Hb) for AA and GA is:

**Variable Name  ** |  **  Analyte **Description**** |  **  LLOD**  
---|---|---  
 LBXACR |   Acrylamide |   3.90  
 LBXGLY |   Glycidamide |   4.90
