### Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (P_PFAS)

####  Data File: P_PFAS.xpt

##### First Published: May 2024

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operation in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used in multiple
commercial applications, including surfactants, lubricants, paints, polishes,
food packaging, and fire-retarding foams. Certain PFAS are used in the
manufacture of polymers used in many industrial and consumer products,
including soil, stain, grease, and water-resistant coatings on textiles and
carpet; uses in the automotive, mechanical, aerospace, chemical, electrical,
medical, and building/construction industries; personal care products; and
non-stick coatings on cookware. Some PFAS are ubiquitous contaminants found in
humans and animals worldwide.

Synthesis of PFAS employed electrochemical fluorination (ECF) or
fluorotelomerization. ECF, used from the 1950s until the early 2000s, yielded
branched and linear isomers. By contrast, fluorotelomerization produces almost
exclusively linear compounds (Vyas, et. al., 2007). The structural isomer
patterns of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in
humans may be useful for understanding routes and sources of exposure
(Benskin, et. al., 2010). Therefore, concentrations of linear PFOA (n-PFOA),
the sum of branched isomers of PFOA (Sb-PFOA, branched PFOA isomers), linear
PFOS (n-PFOS), and the sum of perfluoromethylheptane sulfonate isomers (Sm-
PFOS, monomethyl branched PFOS isomers) were measured in serum.

The calculated sum of isomers in the PFAS (formerly PFC) dataset for the
NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic cycle is comparable to the total levels
reported in previous cycles of NHANES.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample in
the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Online solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid
chromatography-turboionspray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (online SPE-
HPLC-TIS-MS/MS) is used for the quantitative detection of PFAS: 2-(N-methyl-
perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetate (Me-PFOSA-AcOH), perfluorohexane
sulfonate (PFHxS), n-perfluorooctane sulfonate (n-PFOS), the sum of
perfluoromethylheptane sulfonate isomers (Sm-PFOS, monomethyl branched isomers
of PFOS), n-perfluorooctanoate (n-PFOA), the sum of branched
perfluorooctanoate isomers (Sb-PFOA, branched PFOA isomers),
perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate (PFDeA), perfluoroundecanoate
(PFUA), and perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA) 21. Briefly, after dilution with
formic acid, one aliquot of 50 μL of serum is injected into a commercial
column switching system allowing for concentration of the analytes on solid-
phase extraction column. Separation of the analytes from each other and from
other serum components is achieved with high-performance liquid
chromatography. Detection and quantification are done using negative-ion
TurboIonSpray ionization, a variant of electrospray ionization, tandem mass
spectrometry. This method allows for rapid detection of these PFAS in human
serum with limits of detection in the low parts per billion (ppb or ng/mL)
range.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPMs). Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until
they are shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al.,
1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et. al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate
for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
Laboratory Data Overview for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-March 2020, approximately 76%
of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults aged 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Serum PFAS were measured in a one-third subsample of persons 12 years and
over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2017- March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographic
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "L" (ex., LBDPFHSL) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
LBDPFHSL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt(2)). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXPFHS) provides the
analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for each PFAS:

Variable Name | Analyte Description | LLOD  
---|---|---  
LBXPFDE | Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDeA) (ng/mL) | 0.10

LBXNFOS | n-perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (n-PFOS) (ng/mL) | 0.10  
LBXMFOS | Perfluoromethylheptane sulfonic acid isomers (Sm-PFOS) (ng/mL) | 0.10
