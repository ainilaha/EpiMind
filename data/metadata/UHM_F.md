## 2009-2010 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Metals - Urine (UHM_F)

####  Data File: UHM_F.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2011

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Trace metals have been associated with adverse health effects in occupational
studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in general
population groups.

This method is used to achieve rapid and accurate quantifications of multiple
elements of toxicological and nutritional interest. The method is sensitive
and rapid enough to screen urine specimens from subjects suspected to be
exposed to a number of important toxic elements, or to evaluate environmental
or other nonoccupationally exposure to these same elements.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older, who met the subsample requirements, were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. Detailed
specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the General
Documentation on Laboratory Data file for detailed data processing and editing
protocols.

Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a multi-element
analytical technique (Date AR, et al., 1989). Liquid samples are introduced
into the ICP through a nebulizer and spray chamber carried by a flowing argon
stream. By coupling radio-frequency power into flowing argon, plasma is
created in which the predominant species are positive argon ions and
electrons. The sample passes through a region of the plasma that has a
temperature of 6000-8000 ºK. The thermal energy atomizes the sample and then
ionizes the atoms. The ions, along with the argon, enter the mass spectrometer
through an interface that separates the ICP from the mass spectrometer, which
is operating at an atmospheric pressure of 10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer
permits ions at each mass to be detected in rapid sequence, allowing
individual isotopes of an element to be determined. Electrical signals
resulting from the detection of the ions are processed into digital
information that is used to indicate first the intensity of the ions and then
the concentration of the element. The ICP-MS method is used to measure the
following 12 elements in urine: beryllium (Be), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo),
cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), cesium (Cs), barium (Ba), tungsten (W), platinum
(Pt), thallium (TI), lead (Pb), and uranium (U). This method is based on the
method by (Mulligan  KJ, et al. 1990)  Urine samples are diluted 1+9 with 2%
(v/v), double-distilled, concentrated nitric acid containing both iridium (Ir)
and rhodium (Rh) for multi-internal standardization. This procedure can be
used for all 12 elements or for subsets of the 12 elements.

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.

Detailed instructions on [specimen collection and
processing](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf)
can be found in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM).

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
file for detailed data processing and editing protocols.The analytical methods
are described in the _Description of Laboratory Methodology_ section above.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures
Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf). Read
the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2009)
file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

**NHANES Survey Design:**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The Demographic file contains: Status
Variables providing core information on the survey participant including
examination status, Recoded Demographic Variables including age, gender, race
etc., and Interview and Examination Sample Weight Variables and Survey Design
Variables. The Questionnaire Data Files contain socio-economic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on
duration of fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The Demographic, Questionnaire and Phlebotomy
Examination files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.  
Subsample weights

**Subsample weights**

Urinary heavy metals were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6 years
and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2007-2008 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the heavy metals in the data
set.

Lower detection limits for the heavy metals in the data set.:  
Urinary Barium= 0.12 µg/L  
Urinary Beryllium= 0.072 µg/L  
Urinary Cadmium= 0.042 µg/L  
Urinary Cobalt= 0.041 µg/L  
Urinary Cesium= .066 µg/L  
Urinary Molybdenum= .92 µg/L  
Urinary Lead= 0.10 µg/L  
Urinary Platinum= 0.009 µg/L  
Urinary Antimonry= 0.032 ug/L  
Urinary Thallium= 0.015 ug/L  
Urinary Tungsten= 0.021 ug/L  
Urinary Uranium= 0.0017 ug/L

The variable named LBD__LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection. There are two values: "0", and "1". "0" means that the result was
at or above the limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below
the limit of detection. In cases where the result was below the limit of
detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided by the
square root of two.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/)  for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
