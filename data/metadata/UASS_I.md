### Speciated Arsenics - Urine - Special Sample (UASS_I)

####  Data File: UASS_I.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2018

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Arsenic is widely distributed in the earthâs crust and is found most often
in ground water rather than surface water. People encounter arsenic in many
chemical forms that vary greatly in toxicity. The most toxic of the naturally
occurring arsenic compounds are inorganic forms of arsenic and their
methylated metabolites. Less toxic are the organic arsenic compounds.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 18 years and older, who met the regular one-third subsample
selection criteria, were included in this special subsample. Additionally, to
oversample adult smokers, those participants aged 18 years and older, not in
the regular one-third subsample, who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their
entire lifetime (SMQ020=1) and now smoke cigarettes every day (SMQ040=1), were
also included in this special subsample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Arsenobetaine, arsenocholine,  monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid,
arsenous (III) acid, arsenic (V) acid **

The concentration of speciated arsenics is determined by using high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate the species coupled to an
ICP-DRC-MS to detect the arsenic species. This analytical technique is based
on separation by anion-exchange chromatography (IC), followed by detection
using quadrupole ICP-MS technology, and includes DRCâ¢ technology (Baranov VI
et al., 1999), which minimizes or eliminates many argon-based polyatomic
interferences (Tanner S et al., 2000) will require 0.5 mL of urine. Arsenic
species column separation is largely achieved due to differences in charge-
charge interactions of each negatively charged arsenic component in the mobile
phase, with the positively-charged quaternary ammonium groups bound at the
columnâs solid-liquid interface. Upon exit from the column, the
chromatographic eluent goes through a nebulizer, where it is converted into an
aerosol upon entering the spray chamber.

Carried by a stream of argon gas, a portion of the aerosol is transported
through the spray chamber and then through the central channel of the plasma,
where it is heated to temperatures of 6000-8000Â° K. This thermal energy
atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating
at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer,
which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr.

The mass spectrometer permits detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio
in rapid sequence, which allows the determination of individual isotopes of an
element. Once inside the mass spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion
optics, then through the DRCâ¢, and finally through the mass-analyzing
quadrupole before being detected as they strike the surface of the detector.
The ion optics uses an electrical field to focus the ion beam into the DRCâ¢.

The DRCâ¢ component is pressurized with an appropriate reaction gas and
contains a quadrupole. In the DRCâ¢, elimination or reduction of argon-based
polyatomic interferences takes place through the interaction of the reaction
gas with the interfering polyatomic species in the incoming ion beam. The
quadrupole in the DRCâ¢ allows elimination of unwanted reaction by-products
that would otherwise react to form new interferences.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Arsenics - Speciated - Urine Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/labmethods/UAS_UASS_I_MET.PDF)
(June 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al, 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciencesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**  
  
Urinary speciated arsenics were measured in a one-third subsample of persons
18 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.  
  
**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
Albumin & Creatinine â Urine.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).  
  
**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in âLCâ (ex., URDUASLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above
the limit of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDUASLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUAS)
provides the analytic result for the analyte.  
  
The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in Âµg/L) for the speciated arsenics is:

**Variable Name** |  **SAS Label** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URXUAS3 |  Urinary Arsenous Acid |  0.12  
URXUAS5 |  Urinary Arsenic acid |  0.79  
URXUAB |  Urinary Arsenobetaine |  1.16  
URXUAC |  Urinary Arsenocholine |  0.11  
URXUDMA |  Urinary Dimethylarsinic Acid |  1.91  
URXUMMA |  Urinary Monomethylarsonic Acid |  0.20  
  
Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
