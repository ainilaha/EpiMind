### Volatile Organic Compounds - Blood & Related Questionnaire Items (VOCWB_D)

####  Data File: VOCWB_D.xpt

##### First Published: December 2011

##### Last Revised: February 2019

## Component Description

Both the lab data and questionnaire items will be released in this file.

**Volatile Organic Compound Questions**

The volatile organic compound section of the Mobile Examination Center (MEC)
Interview and Phlebotomy Component (PH) provide personal interview data.

**Volatile Organic Compounds (Whole Blood)**

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a large group of chemicals that have
been used as solvents, degreasers, and cleaning agents in industry and
consumer products. Many of the VOCs were found to contaminate ground water and
drinking water sources, and because of human health concerns, have been banned
or restricted from most uses.

The halogenated solvents are VOCs consisting of a hydrocarbon chain or one
hydrocarbon substituted with one or more chlorine or bromine atoms. Most of
these chemicals are used as degreasers and solvents in various products such
as paints. In the past, 1,1,1-trichloroethane was used as a dry cleaning
agent, insect fumigant, and solvent in consumer products; methylene chloride,
perchloroethylene, and trichloroethene are other VOCs that were widely used in
the past.

Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was used as an additive to replace lead in
gasoline, but its use was banned after widespread ground water contamination
was discovered. Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and styrene,
collectively referred to as BTEXS, are components of tobacco smoke and along
with 2,5-dimethyl furan, these VOCs are usually detected in blood of cigarette
smokers at higher levels than in non-smokers. Chlorobenzene
(monochlorobenzene) and the three dichlorobenzenes are halogenated aromatic
hydrocarbons pirmarily used in industrial and chemical synthetic processes.
Chlorobenzene has been used to produce DDT, phenol, and nitrobenzene. The
dichlorobenzenes are also chemical intermediates in synthesis of dyes,
pesticides, and other industrial products. 1,4-Dichlorobenzene (para-
dichlorobenzene) is used also as a moth repellent and as a deodorizer.
Disinfection by-products (DBP) including bromodichloromethane,
dibromochloromethane, bromoform, and chloroform are formed when chlorine
interacts with natural organic materials found in water. Primary sources of
DBPs are chlorinated drinking water and recreational water bodies, such as
swimming pools.

Inhalation is the most common VOC exposure route for the general population,
including indoor sources from such as paints, adhesives, cleaning solutions,
and aerosolized insecticide sprays; from industries producing these solvents;
and from contaminated waste disposal sites. Drinking water may contribute to
exposure when underground drinking water supplies are contaminated. After they
are absorbed in the body, VOCs are rapidly eliminated in exhaled breath or may
be rapidly metabolized and eliminated in the urine.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-half sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Interview Setting and Mode of Administration**

The volatile toxicant questions were asked in the mobile examination center
(MEC). The questions were administered by the phlebotomist or the MEC
interviewers.

**Measurements of Trihalomethanes (THMs) and MTBE in Tap Water**

The prevalence of water disinfection by-products in drinking water supplies
has raised concerns about possible health effects from chronic exposure to
these compounds. The objective is to support studies exploring the
relationship between exposure to THMs and health effects.

This automated analytical method uses headspace solid-phase microextraction
(SPME) coupled with capillary gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This
method quantitates trace levels of THMs (chloroform, bromodichloromethane,
dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) and MTBE in tap water. Detection limits
of less than 100 pg/mL for all analytes and linear ranges of three orders of
magnitude are adequate for measuring the THMs in tap water samples tested from
across the United States. THMs are stable for extended periods in tap water
samples after quenching of residual chlorine and buffering to pH 6.5, thus
enabling larger epidemiologic field studies with simplified sample collection
protocols.

**Measurements of THMs and MTBE in Whole Blood**

The prevalence of water disinfection by-products (e.g. THMs) in tap water has
raised concerns about possible health effects from chronic exposure to these
compounds. Exposure to the fuel oxygenate MTBE has also raised concerns.
People can be exposed to THMs and MTBE through a variety of sources, including
use of household tap water that contains these chemicals. The objective of
this study is to support studies exploring the relationship between health
effects and exposure to THMs and MTBE. THMs and MTBE were quantified in human
blood using capillary gas chromatography (GC) and high-resolution mass
spectrometry (MS) with selected ion mass detection and isotope-dilution
techniques. This method quantified trace levels of THMs (chloroform,
bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane, and bromoform) and MTBE in human
blood. Analyte responses were adequate for measuring background levels after
extraction of these volatile organic compounds with headspace SPME. Detection
limits ranged from 0.3-2.4 pg/mL, with linear ranges of three orders of
magnitude. This method provided adequate sensitivity for measuring the THMs
and MTBE in most blood samples tested from diverse U.S. reference population.

**Measurements of other VOCs in Whole Blood**

Additional VOCs were measured in human blood using SPME in conjunction with
gas chromatography and bench top quadrupole mass spectrometer. A combination
of SPME and multiple single-ion monitoring minimizes the interferences and
chemical noise associated with whole-blood samples. Detection limits are below
50 ppt (pg/mL) for a majority of the VOCs tested.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2005-2006 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in Whole
Blood](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/labmethods/vocwb_d_met_volatile-
organic-compounds.pdf) (Updated January 2017)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf). Vials
are stored under appropriate refrigerated (2-8°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health, for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2005-2006/manuals/lab.pdf).**  
**

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the CDC/NCEH Tobacco and Volatile Branch quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008). **

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2005-2006 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2005)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Whole blood VOCs were measured in a one-half subsample of persons 12 years and
older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2005-2006 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2005)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  
The [Fasting
Questionnaire](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Laboratory&CycleBeginYear=2005)
file includes auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of
venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection limits**

The detection limits were constant in the data set. Two variables are provided
for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in "LC" (ex., LBD2DFLC)
indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: "0" means that
the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. For analytes with analytic results
below the lower limit of detection (ex., LBD2DFLC=1), an imputed fill value
was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable
prefixed URX (ex., LBX2DF) provides the analytic result for that analyte.
