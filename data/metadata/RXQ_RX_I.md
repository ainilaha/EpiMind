## 2015-2016 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Prescription Medications (RXQ_RX_I)

####  Data File: RXQ_RX_I.xpt

##### First Published: January 2019

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Dietary Supplement and Prescription Medication section of the Sample
Person (SP) Questionnaire collects information on: 1) dietary supplements, 2)
nonprescription antacids, 3) prescription medications, and 4) preventive
aspirin use.

The Prescription Medications Questions (variable name prefix RXQ) provides
personal interview data on the use of prescription medications during a one-
month period prior to the participant's interview date. The NHANES 2015-2016
prescription medication questions are similar to the NHANES 1999-2014 and
NHANES III (1988-1994) prescription medication questions.

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The RXQ was asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Participants over 16 years of age
answered for themselves; a proxy provided information for survey participants
who were under 16 years of age and for those who could not answer themselves.

The Interviewer Procedure Manuals and Survey Questionnaires can be found on
the NHANES website. The Dietary Supplement and Prescription Medication section
of the SP Questionnaire are at:  
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/questionnaires/DSQ_I.pdf>.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Data were routinely examined for discrepancies and erroneous entries. All drug
names entered by the interviewer were compared to the medication names
selected from the database. Review of the 2015-2016 data found that 95% of all
reported drugs were automatically matched to the data collection drug
database. This included 81% exact matches, and 14% similar matches. After the
data collection, all similarly matched drug names were reviewed and edited if
either entered or selected drug names were incorrect. The 5% that were not
matched to the drug database were also reviewed and edited. The most common
reasons for a non-match were incorrect spelling of the drug, insufficient
detail to identify the drug, or reporting of a nonprescription product that
was not in the drug database.

Similar to the previous 2013-2014 survey cycle, a list of possible reasons for
use assigned to each drug was incorporated into the computer to assist the
data collection. Review of the 2015-2016 data found that 85% of all reported
reasons were selected from the list. The 15% that were entered in the reason
field were edited, at NCHS, after data collection.

## Data Processing and Editing

**Data Collection Methods**

During the household SP interview, survey participants are asked if they have
taken medications in the past 30 days for which they needed a prescription.
Those who answer "yes" are asked to show the interviewer the medication
containers of all the products used. For each medication reported, the
interviewer enters the product's complete name from the container into a
computer. If no container is available, the interviewer asks the participant
to verbally report the name of the medication.

When the interviewer enters the medication name into the computer, the name is
automatically matched to a prescription drug database on the computer to
identify an exact match or similar text matches (refer below for details on
the prescription medication database). The interviewer then selects the best
match from a drug list of possible matches. The original product entered by
the interviewer and the product selected from the computer drug list are saved
as separate variables for quality control purposes. If an exact or similar
match of the medication cannot be found in the database, the interviewer is
instructed to select "drug not found on list."

Participants were also asked how long they have been taking the medication and
the main reason for use. A list of possible reasons (indications of medication
use and possible off-label use) pre-assigned to each selected drug is
displayed on the computer. The interviewer is instructed to select up to 3
reasons from the reason list that best match to the main reason described by
the participant. If an appropriate reason is not available, the interviewer is
instructed to enter the main reason as described by the participant.

The NHANES 2015-2016 RXQ can be accessed in the Dietary Supplements and
Prescription Medications section of the SP Questionnaire:  
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/questionnaires/DSQ_I.pdf>.

**Prescription Medication Questions Included in this Data Release**

  * Was any prescription medication taken in the past 30 days? 
  * Medication name 
  * Was medication container seen by interviewer? 
  * How long was medication taken? 
  * What is the main reason for which you use medication? 
  * Number of prescription medications taken? 

**Prescription Medication Database for Data Collection**

NCHS used Lexicon Plus速, a proprietary database of Cerner Multum, Inc. to
assist in data collection. Lexicon Plus速 is a comprehensive database of all
prescription and some nonprescription drug products available in the U.S. drug
market. For NHANES, the Lexicon Plus速 files were modified and uploaded to a
laptop computer and incorporated into a search engine for use by interviewers.
The computer file was updated at the beginning of each survey year to
incorporate changes to Lexicon Plus速 and include products approved and
available to the U.S. public in the prior year.

**Data Editing**

**General editing of data**

When a variable was modified globally, as part of the editing process, the
third letter in the variable name was changed from a Q (i.e., RXQ) to a D
(i.e., RXD). For example, variables that were obtained from an external drug
database will have the letter "D" in the third position of the variable name.

**Prescription medications incorrectly reported in other subsections of
questionnaire**

_**Prescription antacids**_ that were incorrectly reported in the
nonprescription antacid section of the questionnaire were removed from the
antacid file and added to the prescription medication file._****_

_**Prescription supplements**_ are released in the Dietary Supplements Data
file. Some prescription medications were mistakenly recorded in the dietary
supplement section. These were removed from that file and added to the
prescription medication file. Any prescription dietary supplement that was
incorrectly reported in the prescription medication section was removed from
the prescription medication section and moved to the dietary supplement
section. The following products were moved to the Dietary Supplements files
(DSQ):

  * All calcium products except calcium acetate 
  * All fluoride products except those in topical gel or cream forms (e.g., stannous fluoride) 
  * All vitamins except the injection form of vitamins 
  * Over-the-counter niacin, niacinamide, nicotinic acid, and fish oil 

All prescription niacin, fish oil, potassium, and sodium products were
retained in the prescription medication file. Injectable prescription vitamin
B or iron were also retained in the prescription medication file.

Products reported in the prescription medication section that were only
available as an _**over-the-counter product**_ during 2015-2016 were removed
from the prescription medication file, except over-the-counter insulin, and
products containing pseudoephedrine.

**Specific variables and edits**

**RXDUSE:** Have you taken or used any prescription medicines in the past
month?

This variable was the lead-in question to the series of questions on
prescription medication use. It accounts for all prescription medications
except prescription dietary supplements, which are included in the dietary
supplement files (DSQ). A small number of persons refused to answer this
question (coded 7) or did not know whether they used a prescription medication
in the past month (coded 9).  
This variable was edited and takes into account prescription medications
reported in this section as well as prescription medications moved into this
file from the dietary supplements or nonprescription antacids sections of the
questionnaire.

**RXDCOUNT:** The number of prescription medicines taken?

This variable was computed at NCHS and represents the total number of
prescription medications reported by the participant, including those drugs
identified as unknown (RXDDRUG = 55555). The count has been adjusted for all
prescription medications moved into and those moved out of the prescription
medication section. However, the count is not a comprehensive count of all
prescription medications used by a participant because prescription dietary
supplements are part of the dietary supplement section. There were also
participants who reported the use of a prescription medication in the past
month (RXDUSE = 1) but did not know the name of the medication (RXDDRUG =
99999) or refused to report the name of the medication (RXDDRUG = 77777). Each
product reported as "refused" or "don't know" is still included in the total
count of prescription medications used under RXDCOUNT.

**RXQSEEN:** Medicine container seen by interviewer?

There was no editing of this variable.

**RXDDAYS:** For how long have you been taking this medicine?

This variable was created from a two-part (number and unit) question and
indicates how long the participant reported taking each prescription
medication. Responses were recorded in days, weeks, months, and years. To
facilitate analysis, all answers were converted to days using conversion
factors of 7 days per week, 30.4 days per month, and 365 days per year. The
length of use was top coded to 21900 days. There were persons who reported the
use of a prescription medication but did not know how long they had been using
the medication (RXDDAYS = 99999) or refused to report the length of use
(RXDDAYS = 77777). There were also persons who reported the use of a
prescription medication but did not report the length of use. RXDDAYS is
missing for those persons.

**Drug Database for Data Release**

NCHS used Lexicon Plus速, a proprietary database of Cerner Multum, Inc. to
assist with data editing and release. The December 2016 Multum Lexicon
database was used for creating the RXQ_RX_I data release file. For additional
information, refer to the RXQ_DRUG documentation.

**Creation of additional data release variables**

**RXDDRUG:** Generic drug name

All reported drug names were converted to a standard generic drug name for
data release. For multi-ingredient products, the ingredients were listed in
alphabetical order (i.e., Acetaminophen; Codeine).

There were participants who reported the use of a prescription medication but
did not know the name of the drug or refused to report the name. These entries
were coded as don't know (99999) and refused (77777), respectively. There were
also medications reported with insufficient detail to accurately identify the
exact product, but there was some information about the therapeutic class of
the drug. These products have been released with Multum's therapeutic category
name followed by "\- unspecified" (e.g., anti-infective - unspecified;
hormones/hormone modifiers - unspecified). The names of a limited number of
reported drugs could not be identified by NCHS as a known prescription
product. These entries were counted as prescription medications, since there
is no evidence that they are not, and have been coded as 55555, unknown drug.

**RXDDRGID:** Generic drug code

Each generic drug name is associated with a unique generic drug code from
Multum's Lexicon Drug Database. Multum's generic drug code is always beginning
with a "d". There were some drug names reported by NHANES' participants that
were not found in the Lexicon drug database. These have been assigned unique
drug codes beginning with an "a" or "h". Unspecified products with known
therapeutic action have drug codes beginning with a "c" and are followed by
their respective Multum therapeutic category code. RXDDRGID is missing for
unknown drugs (55555), refused (77777), or don't know (99999) RXDDRUG entries.

Therapeutic class codes associated with a drug are found in a separate data
release file, RXQ_DRUG.

**International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, Clinical
Modification (ICD-10-CM) Code for Data release**

The ICD-10-CM is a system used by physicians and other healthcare providers to
classify and code all diagnoses, symptoms and procedures recorded in
conjunction with hospital care in the United States. To facilitate data
analysis, NCHS used ICD-10-CM codes
(<https://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes>) to classify the health problems
participants reported as the main reason for taking the prescription
medication. Thus, the associated ICD-10-CM codes were based on participant
reported reason and not directly reported by a doctor or other health
professional or by a review of the medical record. ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes
have between 3 and 7 characters. In general, the self-reported health problems
were coded to the fourth digit ICD-10-CM level of specificity. However, in
some cases only the first three digits as the heading of a category of codes
was used; and in other cases the six digits ICD-10-CM level of specificity was
used. See the Appendix for a list of ICD-10-CM codes and description assigned
to reasons for use reported by NHANES participants.

**Reason for use (as reported by participant) data release variables**

**RXDRSC1-- RXDRSC3:** ICD-10-CM code

The participants' reported reasons were converted to an ICD-10-CM code for
data release. Up to a maximum of 3 ICD-10-CM codes were used if multiple
reasons were reported for a specific medication use. When reported reason was
for disease prevention, an appropriate ICD-10-CM code followed by a letter "P"
was used. (e.g., A49.9P Prevent bacterial infection; D75.9P Prevent blood
clots). When reported reason was not specific enough to be assigned an
ICD-10-CM code for the subtype of disease, an ICD-10-CM code for a most common
subtype of disease was used (e.g., E11 for diabetes; E78.0 for high
cholesterol). When reported reason did not indicate a single episode or
recurrent, an ICD-10-CM code for a single episode was used (e.g., F32.9 for
depression). When reported reason was a symptom due to an underline disease, a
disease code was used (e.g., I51.9 for fluid retention due to heart problem;
K76.9 for fluid retention due to liver problem).

There were participants who reported the use of a prescription medication but
did not know why they took it or refused to report the reason for use. These
were coded as 99999, don't know, and 77777, refused, respectively. There were
a number of reported reasons that could not be converted to an appropriate
ICD-10-CM code. These entries have been grouped into unspecified ICD-10-CM
codes or coded as 55555, unknown. A few rare diseases were also coded as
55555, unknown.

**RXDRSD1-- RXDRSD3:** ICD-10-CM code description

Each ICD-10-CM code is associated with a description (diseases, symptoms,
health status, and so on). RXDRSD1 is missing for unknown reasons (55555),
refused (77777), or don't know (99999) RXDRSC1 entries.

There are two files related to the prescription drug data. The contents of
each file are described below. The files can be linked by the variable
RXDDRGID.

The file named RXQ_RX_I contains data on all survey participants and their use
of a prescription drug. Participants who reported the use of multiple
prescription drugs will have multiple records, that is, a record for each
drug.

The file named RXQ_DRUG contains therapeutic drug class information on all
drugs reported by NHANES participants from 1988-1994 through 2015-2016\. It
contains drug (up to 4) and ingredient (up to 6) therapeutic category codes
for each drug. It also has a variable that identifies if the drug is made of a
single ingredient or multiple ingredients.

## Analytic Notes

The variable RXDCOUNT provides a count of all prescription products reported
in the RXQ adjusting for products moved into or out of the final file. The
count includes products reported as "refused" or "don't know" by participants
who reported they had taken a prescription medication but did not know the
name of the medication or refused to report the name of the medication. Drugs
released as "unknown drug" are also included in the count. However,
prescription supplements in the DSQ are not included in the total count.
Therefore, this variable does not provide a comprehensive count of all
prescription products used by the survey participant.

In some cases, it may appear as though participants reported the same
prescription drug more than once. That is, the same generic drug name and code
may be listed more than once. There are a several reason for these duplicates.
Participants may have reported different brand names, which had the same
generic drug name (e.g., "Glucophage" or "Glumetza" vs. "Metformin"). The
medications may have been different forms or dosages of the same product
(e.g., Albuterol "oral tablet" vs. "inhalation solution" or Aripiprazole "2
mg" vs. "5 mg"). Participants may have reported different lengths of use or
reasons for use of the products.

The health problem as the main reason for taking medication was self-reported.
The released variables, ICD-10-CM codes/description, were used to classify the
health problems related to the medication use, and should not be considered as
diagnoses from physicians.

During the data editing process, outlier values were examined. When there was
insufficient information to conclude that values were invalid, they were left
in the data set. Analysts should examine the distribution of the data and
consider if it is appropriate to include or exclude extreme values in a given
analysis.

Respondent sequence number (SEQN) in the prescription medication data is not a
unique identifier. Participants who reported the use of multiple prescription
drugs will have multiple records, that is, a record for each drug. Analysts
should convert a drug-level data to a person-level data, that is, a record for
each person, before merging it with NHANES demographic and other data files by
using SEQN.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
