### Hepatitis C: RNA (HCV-RNA) and Hepatitis C Genotype (HEPC_H)

####  Data File: HEPC_H.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2015

#####  Last Revised: September 2017

#####  Note: Because the confirmatory test for the Hepatitis C screening test
was discontinued by the manufacturer a confirmed Hepatitis C antibody (Anti-
HCV) will be retested by another confirmatory test and released at a later
date.

## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in the
United States. Recommendations have also been developed for the prevention and
control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of
asymptomatic infection with these viruses, information about the prevalence of
these diseases is needed to monitor prevention efforts. By testing a
nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, NHANES will provide
the most reliable estimates of age-specific prevalence needed to evaluate the
effectiveness of the strategies to prevent these infections. In addition,
NHANES provides the means to better define the epidemiology of other hepatitis
viruses. NHANES testing for markers of infection with hepatitis viruses will
be used to determine secular trends in infection rates across most age and
racial/ethnic groups, and will provide a national picture of the epidemiologic
determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA)**

The COBAS AMPLICOR HCV MONITOR Test, version 2 0 (v2.0) is an in vitro nucleic
acid amplification test for the quantitation of Hepatitis C Virus RNA in human
serum or plasma on the COBAS AMPLICOR Analyzer.

**Hepatitis C genotype**

The VERSANT ® HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay (LiPA) is a line probe assay designed to
identify Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 to 6 in human serum or EDTA
plasma samples. Subtype information is available in the majority of cases.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for
Hepatitis C RNA and Hepatitis C genotype in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.
However, b/c the confirmatory test for the Hepatitis C screening test was
discontinued by the manufacturer a confirmed Hepatitis C antibody (Anti-HCV)
will be retested by another confirmatory test and released at a later date.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Blood specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for
analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral
Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center
for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention's quality control and
quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013 - 2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/fastqx_h.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower limits of
detection (LLODs) isn't applicable.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
