## Component Description

Serologic tests are available to determine who has become infected with
toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasma-specific IgG antibodies are detectable 1-3 weeks
after infection and remain detectable for the life of the individual.
Toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies are also detectable 1-3 weeks after
infection but generally decline to nil by one year after infection. The
presence of both IgG and IgM is evidence for infection within the last year.
The presence of IgG antibody without IgM is considered indicative of past
infection. All eligible participants were tested for serum IgG and positive
sera were tested for the presence of IgM. These data will be used to estimate
the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in the U.S. and to determine if the rates are
changing over time. Toxoplasma IgG antibody was measured in NHANES III with an
overall prevalence of 22.5%.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 to 49 years were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Toxoplasma (IgG)**

The presence and quantity of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in the test
sample were determined by performing an EIA test with Toxoplasma antigen. A
standard curve was constructed using optical density readings from positive
control sera wells; these readings were calibrated to WHO Toxo 60 serum and
read as International Units (IU/mL). Those test samples with results below 10
IU/mL indicated a non-significant level of antibody; thus, they were
considered to be negative, indicating no infection. Those test samples with
results greater than 9 IU/mL were considered to be positive, indicating
Toxoplasma infection at some undetermined time.

**Toxoplasma (IgM)**

The presence and quantity of IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in the test
sample were determined by performing an IgM capture EIA test with Toxoplasma
antigen. Results are obtained by dividing the optical density of the test
sample well by the optical density of the positive standard well and
multiplying the result by 100. Those test samples exhibiting ratios below 2.0
indicated a non-significant level of IgM antibody according to this technique;
thus, they were considered to be negative for IgM antibodies. Those test
samples with ratios equal to or greater than 2.0 were considered to be IgM
positive, indicating either Toxoplasma infection within the last 2 years or a
false-positive reaction.

**Toxoplasma (Dye)**

The presence and quantity of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in the test
sample were determined by performing the Sabin-Feldman Dye Test with live
Toxoplasma organisms. Test samples are diluted and mixed with dye and live
organisms. If the sample dilution contains antibodies to Toxoplasma, the
organisms are lysed and unable to take up the dye. The titer reported is that
dilution of serum at which half of the organisms are not killed (stained) and
the other half are killed (unstained). Those test samples with results less
than 1:16 indicated a non-significant level of antibody; thus, they were
considered to be negative, indicating no infection. Those test samples with
results equal to or greater than 1:16 were considered to be positive,
indicating Toxoplasma infection at some undetermined time.

**Toxoplasma Differential Agglutination and Toxoplasma Differential
Agglutination Interpretation**

The presence and quantity of antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in the test
sample were determined by performing the Differential Agglutination Test with
Toxoplasma organisms. Test samples are diluted; one aliquot is mixed with
formalin-fixed organisms and another aliquot is mixed with methanol-fixed
organisms. Agglutination titers are reported for both types of fixed organisms
and the combined results are interpreted by comparison of titers.

Test samples are classified as having a nonacute pattern, an equivocal
pattern, or an acute pattern. The results may be useful in determining whether
the patient has an acute infection or not.

**Toxoplasma (Avidity) and Toxoplasma (Avidity) IgG Interpretation**

The avidity of IgG antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii in the test sample was
determined by performing the IgG Avidity Assay with Toxoplasma organisms.

Optical density results of the test sample well are compared with and without
dissociation treatment. The index is the percentage of antibodies that resist
dissociation. Test samples are classified as having low, equivocal, or high
avidity. The results may be useful in determining whether the patient has an
acute infection or not.

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of Parasitic
Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia for analysis. Detailed specimen collection
and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical
Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
Description of the Laboratory Methodology section.

One derived variable (LBDTO1) was added to the file. Since the upper detection
limit of the assay is 240 all values greater than 240 were recoded to 240.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2001-2002 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2001-2002
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such
as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and
phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Toxoplasmosis antibody**

These data are released as International Units (IU). Though the data are
released as individual units the data should be analyzed qualitatively and
categorized as positive = IU >=10 and negative 0-9IU.

**LBDT01**

This test was performed on all examinees aged 6-49 years.

**LBXT02**

This test was performed only if LBXT01 was equal to or greater than 10.

**LBXT03, LBXT04 AND LBXT04IN**

These tests were performed only if LBXTO2 was equal to or greater than 2.0.

**LBXT05 AND LBXT05IN**

These tests were performed only if LBXTO3 was equal to or greater than 16
