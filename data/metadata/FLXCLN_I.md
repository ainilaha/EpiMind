below should be strongly considered when determining whether the NHANES
clinical fluorosis assessment data are appropriate for analytic objectives.

## Component Description

Dental fluorosis clinical assessment was included in the NHANES oral health
examination to monitor fluorosis in the population for selected age groups.
Fluoride exposure, from any source, during the period of tooth development is
associated with increased risk of developing dental (or enamel) fluorosis.
Dental fluorosis is characterized by an increasing porosity or
hypomineralization of the tooth enamel that leads to visual changes of the
enamel that appear once a tooth erupts (Dean, 1934; Fejerskov et al., 1990).
The severity of dental fluorosis depends on the dose and duration of fluoride
ingestion during tooth development (Dean, 1942; Fejerskov et al., 1990).

In the United States, dental fluorosis is generally considered a cosmetic
effect with no negative functional effect (Kaminsky et al., 1990; Fluoride
Recommendation Work Group, 2001; US Department of Health and Human Services,
2015). The severe form of dental fluorosis, however, may have adverse dental
effects because the pitting can compromise the protective function of the
enamel and the affected area can break away (Clark and Slayton, 2014;
Fejerskov, et al., 1990; National Research Council, 2006; US Department of
Health and Human Services, 2015). But the severe form is rare in the U.S.
(Beltran 2010; National Research Council, 2006).

## Eligible Sample

A dental fluorosis clinical assessment was conducted on survey participants
aged 6-29 years who received the Oral Health Examination (exam status code,
OHDEXSTS, is complete or partial).



## Protocol and Procedure

The 2015-2016 dental fluorosis clinical assessment followed the same protocols
as conducted in 1999-2004 and 2011-2014.

The dental fluorosis clinical assessment was conducted at the NHANES mobile
examination center (MEC) by dental examiners, who were dentists (D.D.S. or
D.M.D.) licensed in at least one U.S. state. A health technician assisted in
entering all examiner observations directly into a computerized data
collection system at the MEC. Examiners used a surface reflecting mirror for
the assessment. Teeth were not dried with air before assessment.

All fully erupted, permanent teeth (excluding third molars) were evaluated.
The dental fluorosis clinical assessment proceeded tooth-by-tooth in a similar
manner as the dental caries assessment, beginning with the maxillary right
central incisor and proceeding posteriorly to the upper second molar. Then,
the same sequence was repeated for the upper left, lower left, and lower right
quadrants of the mouth.

Each tooth was scored according to the Dean's Fluorosis Index (DFI) and
assigned one of the DFI disease severity categories (Table 1), based on the
area of the tooth surface with visible fluorosis and presence of pitting:
normal (DFI=0), questionable (5), very mild (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or
severe (4) (Dean, 1934; Dean, 1942). Missing teeth, deciduous (primary) teeth,
permanent teeth not fully erupted, and teeth in which more than one-half of
the visible surface area was obscured by a restoration, caries, or orthodontic
appliance were not assessed. These teeth were coded as cannot be assessed (9).
A tooth having a non-fluoride opacity was coded as 8. [The NHANES Oral Health
Examiners Manual
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_Oral_Health_Examiners_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
provides detail on assessing a tooth for fluorosis.



**Table 1.** Dean's Fluorosis Index (DFI) criteria and scoring on the NHANES
dental fluorosis clinical assessment

NHANES DFI Value  |  Fluorosis Severity Level  |  Description   
---|---|---  
0 | Normal | No fluorosis detected  
1 | Very mild | Opaque, paperwhite areas involving less than ¼ of the tooth surface  
2 | Mild | Opaque, paperwhite areas involving ¼ to less than ½ of the tooth surface  
3 | Moderate | Opaque paperwhite areas involving ½ or more of the tooth surface  
4 | Severe | Discrete or confluent pitting in involved areas  
5 | Questionable | Slight aberration of normal enamel appearance, including white flecks  
8 | Non-fluoride opacity | Coded if non-fluoride opacity   
9 | Cannot be assessed | Coded if the tooth was missing, not fully erupted, one-half or more of the tooth was replaced with a restoration, covered with orthodontic band, or destroyed by caries.  


## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The specific QA practices for the dental fluorosis clinical assessment are
documented in detail in the [NHANES Oral Health Examiners
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_Oral_Health_Examiners_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

All dental examiners received an initial training which consisted of lecture,
model review, practice simulations and standardization sessions. Following
successful initial training, examiners received field training at the MEC
consisting of more practice simulations, standardizations, and calibration
sessions.

During data collection, the reference examiner visited each dental examiner
2-3 times a year to conduct a random number of replicate examinations during
each visit. The reference examiner determined if retraining and future
monitoring of the dental examiner was needed. The reference examiner also
conducted an annual retraining session for all dental examiners to reinforce
existing protocols and to introduce protocol updates as needed.

Since 1999, data for the oral health examination have been recorded directly
onto a computerized data collection system at the MEC. The system is
integrated centrally and allows for ongoing monitoring of much of the data. As
part of the quality control practice, all data are reviewed systematically for
logical inconsistencies. Before data release, the collected data are further
reviewed.

## Data Processing and Editing

While the dental examiners assess the teeth in quadrants, starting from the
central incisor and moving to the molars, the data files are produced with the
teeth numbered using the Universal or ADA Dental Numbering System. Note that
there is no data for tooth numbers 1, 16, 17, and 32. Third molars were not
assessed in this clinical examination.

## Analytic Notes

**1999-2004 and 2011-2016 DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT CONCLUSIONS**

NHANES is currently the only survey providing national estimates on dental
fluorosis. Two-year estimates of fluorosis prevalence by DFI category
demonstrated variability within and across the six year time periods. Inter-
examiner reliability statistics found that agreement ranged from 0.51-0.98 for
the nine primary dental examiners in 1999-2016. These values indicate moderate
(0.41-0.60) to almost perfect (0.81-0.99) agreement based on Landis and Koch,
and mostly adequate agreement (33 out 36 kappas >=0.6) based on McHugh. There
was also high percent agreement in defining very mild or greater fluorosis.
The proportion of the total number of examinations for which a gold standard
examination was conducted was, however, low and the DFI scoring method has
high examiner subjectivity. The observed increase in dental fluorosis
prevalence with age between 2001-2004 and 2011-2014, based on the analysis of
the synthetic cohort, is not biologically plausible. This suggests that there
may have been some change in the way the examiners evaluated the level of
fluorosis over time.

The quality assessment findings in this document should be strongly considered
when determining whether these data are appropriate for the user's analytic
objectives, including studies of prevalence and trends. An NCHS Vital and
Health Statistics Series 2 Report on the data quality for the NHANES 1999-2004
and 2011-2016 dental fluorosis clinical assessment data is available at [NCHS
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/series/series02.htm) (National
Center for Health Statistics and National Center for Chronic Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion, 2019).

**DATA EVALUATION OF 1999-2004 AND 2011-2016 FLUOROSIS CLINICAL ASSESSMENT
DATA**

As described previously, several QA processes were implemented during the
dental fluorosis clinical assessment. In addition, evaluation of rater
variability and reliability was assessed on the final data. The summary of the
data evaluation of the dental fluorosis clinical assessment data from
1999-2004 and 2011-2016 for participants aged 6-19 years (the common age range
across all survey years) is provided below.

For these analyses, a person was assigned a dental fluorosis severity value
based on the lesser of the two most affected tooth-level DFI values. For all
analyses, tooth-level DFI value of cannot be assessed (code 9) and non-
fluoride opacity (code 8) were recoded to missing and questionable recoded to
0.5. Only youth with at least two teeth with a non-missing DFI value were
assigned a person-level DFI and included in further analyses. Qualitative
interpretation of numeric kappa statistic value ranges are: less than chance
agreement (<0), slight agreement (0.00-0.20), fair agreement (0.21-0.40),
moderate agreement (0.41-0.60), substantial agreement (0.61-0.80), and almost
perfect (0.81-0.99) (Landis and Koch, 1977). Kappa <0.60 may also be used as a
general indicator of inadequate agreement among raters (McHugh 2012).

**Intra-Examiner Reliability: Evaluation of Replicate Examinations from 1999
-2001 **

During 1999-2001, approximately 10% of examined participants aged 6-49 had a
repeat second fluorosis examination. Details on these replicate examinations
were previously published (Dye et al. 2007) and are summarized here. The
weighted kappa statistics comparing the DFI values for the same participant by
the same examiner ranged from 0.56 - 0.72, across the three main dental
examiners who conducted examinations from 1999 through 2001. These kappa
values are considered moderate to substantial agreement. The difference in DFI
values for the same teeth assessed in the same way days apart, however,
indicates the subjective nature of the DFI scoring method.

**Inter-Examiner Reliability: Evaluation of Gold Standard Examinations from
1999 -2004 and 2011-2016 **

Gold standard examinations were conducted by a reference examiner on 3.6%
(n=356) and 2.8% (n=210) of participants aged 6-19 years in 1999-2004 and
2011-2016, respectively. Complete data for analysis (i.e., at least two teeth
with valid DFI values for both examiner and reference) were available for 339
participants aged 6-19 years in 1999-2004 and 198 in 2011-2016. These analyses
did not use the survey examination weights.

Weighted kappa statistics were computed using different weighting schemes
(explained below) which assigned specific values to the various possible
levels of disagreement between dental examiner and reference examiner on the
DFI scale (i.e., difference in one category, two categories, etc.).

Unweighted kappa (Cohen et al. 1960) assigns a weight of 1 for perfect
agreement (e.g., examiner DFI = 1 and reference DFI =1) and 0 for no agreement
(e.g., examiner DFI = 1 and reference DFI =2); Custom #1 weights assigned 1
for perfect agreement, 0.667 for 1 category difference, 0.333 for a 2 category
difference, and 0 for more than 2 categories; Custom #2 (based on Kumar et al.
2000) assigned 1 for perfect agreement, 0.5 for 1 category difference, and 0
for all others; the other two weighting schemes were based on Cicchetti and
Allison (1971) and Fleiss and Cohen (1973). Unweighted kappa values for
examiners ranged from 0.35 to 0.78, with five of nine examiners having values
below 0.60 during the two 6-year time periods (Table 2). When considering the
results across all four weighting schemes, the agreement between the dental
examiners and reference examiner ranged from 0.51 through 0.87 for the five
primary dental examiners who conducted examinations in 1999-2004 and from 0.60
through 0.98 for the four primary examiners during 2011-2016. For both time
periods, these reliability statistics would be considered moderate to almost
perfect agreement based on the Landis and Koch interpretation of kappa values.
When McHugh's requirement of a kappa value of at least 0.60 for adequate
agreement is applied, the majority of the kappa values indicate adequate
agreement (i.e., 33 out of 36 kappa values (computed for 9 examiners for 4
different weighting schemes) were at or above 0.60).

NOTES: All kappa statistics were computed using the following Dean's Fluorosis
Index values: 0 = Normal, 0.5 = Questionable (recoded from collected value of
5), 1 = Very mild; 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Severe. All values of 8 (non-
fluoride opacity) and 9 (could not assess) were set to missing.



**Percent agreement between dental and reference examiners in categorizing
fluorosis**

When DFI categories are collapsed into broader categories and fluorosis is
defined as mild or greater severity, the examiner and reference agreed on
88.8% of cases in 1999-2004; agreement was 89.4% in 2011-2016. When fluorosis
is defined as moderate or severe, agreement is 97.1% in 1999-2004 and 94.4% in
2011-2016. It is expected that agreement would improve when broader categories
are assessed since agreement is achieved as long as both examiners rate the
same DFI category or higher.

As a means of detecting systematic scoring biases, differences between the
dental examiner and reference examiner were further explored by examining the
direction of the disagreement between the dental examiner's and the reference
examiner's person-level DFI values (Table 3). Among the cases where there was
disagreement between the examiner and reference, in 1999-2004, the examiner
scored higher than the reference examiner on 48.8% of these cases, while the
reference examiner scored higher than the dental examiner on 51.2%. In
2011-2016, the examiner scored higher than the reference examiner on 54.8% of
cases, whereas the reference examiner scored higher than the examiner on
45.2%. The majority of the disagreement was by one DFI level: 82.7% in
1999-2004 and 88.7% in 2011-2016\.

questionable and reference score = very mild is reported in this table as
differing by 1 level.



Overall, for the two 6-year survey periods, there was similarity between the
dental examiner and reference examiners in the person-level DFI values (Table
4). In 1999-2004, 48.7% were classified by the dental examiner and 49.8% by
the reference examiner with DFI values of very mild or greater. In 2011-2016,
the percentages were 74.2% and 73.7%, respectively.

**Prevalence of Dental Fluorosis Severity Among Youth**

Weighted 2- and 6-year estimates of dental fluorosis severity were computed on
children 6-19 years (the common age range across all years) who had at least 2
teeth with a non-missing DFI value (1999-2004, n=9395; 2011-2016, n=7158).
These analyses used the examination sample weights.

During 1999-2004, 25.3% (SE=1.5) of youth 6-19 years were estimated to have
very mild fluorosis, 7.7% (SE=0.5) mild, 3.2% (SE=0.4) moderate, and 0.4%
(SE=0.1) severe (Table 5, Figure 1). In 2011-2016, 35.6% (SE=2.5) of youth
6-19 years were estimated to have very mild fluorosis, 21.5% (SE=2.2) mild,
13.4% (SE=1.5) moderate, and 1.0% (SE=0.2) severe (Table 5, Figure 2). In
1999-2004, 3.6% of youth 6-19 years had moderate or severe fluorosis; whereas,
in 2011-2016 the percent increased to 14.4%.

Variability in the prevalence of different dental fluorosis severity levels
was seen within each 6-year time period, as well as across the two time
periods (Table 5, Figures 1 and 2). For example, during 1999-2004,
questionable fluorosis ranged from 0.4% to 34.6%. During 2011-2016, mild
fluorosis prevalence ranged from 9.1% to 40.4% and moderate fluorosis
prevalence ranged from 1.3% to 20.6%.

**Assessing Biological Plausibility of Prevalence Estimates**

Further evaluation was conducted on the NHANES 1999-2004 and 2011-2016 dental
fluorosis clinical assessment data to determine whether the prevalence
estimates presented above could be consistent with the known etiology of
fluorosis.

Fluoride ingestion prior to tooth eruption is the only known cause of
fluorosis (Fejerskov et al., 1990); therefore, there should be no change in
fluorosis prevalence among erupted permanent teeth of the same tooth type in
the same birth cohort over time. For this analysis, a synthetic birth cohort
that included youth aged 6-9 years in 2001-2004 (born 1992-1998; n=1097) and
youth aged 16-19 years in 2011-2014 (born 1992-1998; n=1193) was constructed
to determine if the percent with fluorosis, for a given tooth type
(specifically first permanent molars, which usually appear between 6-7 years;
ADA, 2006) was constant with age, as would be expected given that fluorosis
develops before teeth erupt. Logistic regression and computed predictive
marginals were used to estimate the prevalence of mild or greater and moderate
or severe dental fluorosis in the first permanent molars (identified in the
data file as tooth numbers 3, 14, 19, 30) among youth aged 6-9 years in
2001-2004 and 16-19 years in 2011-2014. Adjusted models, which included sex
and race and Hispanic origin, were run to control for possible population
changes over the time period.

Prevalence (adjusted for age and race and Hispanic origin) of mild or greater
fluorosis in the first permanent molars of youth aged 6-9 years in 2001-2004
was 9.5% (standard error (SE) = 0.01) and among youth aged 16-19 years in
2011-2014 was 46.9% (SE = 0.04, p<.001). This increase between surveys was
unexpected, because the prevalence of fluorosis in the first permanent molar
should not change over time among a similar birth cohort given that tooth
eruption has already occurred by 6-9 years of age. Similarly, adjusted
prevalence of moderate and severe fluorosis in the first permanent molars of
the birth cohort increased from 2.8% (SE = 0.01) in 2001-2004 to 17.7% (SE =
0.3) in 2011-2014 (p<.001). Estimates were similar in unadjusted models.

**Impact of Oversampling in NHANES**

During 1999-2016, there were changes in the racial and ethnic composition of
the U.S. population. Also, in 2011-2016, NHANES started oversampling Asian
American persons and continued the oversampling of Hispanic persons, which
began in 2007. The oversampling of adolescents was also discontinued in 2007.
It may be possible that underlying changes in the population composition of
the U.S. or NHANES sample design changes affected the overall prevalence
estimates of dental fluorosis and contributed to some of the observed
differences in estimates between 1999-2004 and 2011-2016\.

Closer examination of the race and Hispanic origin estimates from 2011-2016,
however, showed no differences in the prevalence of dental fluorosis for the
specific severity categories across the different race and Hispanic origin
groups. In 1999-2004, the race and Hispanic origin groups (specifically, non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American) follow a similar
pattern to 2011-2016 (data not shown).

**Impact of Geographic Variation in Water Fluoridation Levels  **

Determining the water fluoridation level in a given NHANES location is not
straightforward given that a county may include multiple water systems. For
example, in 2013, there were 345 total public water systems (PWSs) for seven
of the NHANES locations visited that year. Nine of the 345 PWSs had levels
higher than 1.2 mg/L. These nine were all from a location with a substantial
number of PWSs.

As stated earlier, dental fluorosis typically occurs from fluoride exposure
during early tooth development before eruption, typically. Therefore, water
fluoride levels many years before the NHANES examination would need to be
assessed to determine exposure levels rather than levels for participants at
the time of examination. For example, fluoride exposure for a 19-year-old
participant examined in 1999 would have occurred during 1980-1986\.
Determining actual fluoride exposure during childhood, however, is further
complicated by the uncertainty of migration patterns among families (i.e., if
they ever moved, taking them from one PWS to another).

**1999-2004 and 2011-2016 DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT SUMMARY**

There are potential sources of error in the measurement of fluorosis in
general, and specifically in sample surveys, such as NHANES. For time-varying
factors, these may include intra-subject (within subject) variation and intra-
or inter-examiner (within or between examiner) variations in measurement.
Within-subject variation could occur if there were changes in the underlying
disease process between assessments. However, dental fluorosis is the result
of exposure to fluoride from when a child is born up to about 8 years of age.
Therefore, intra-subject variability due to physiological or biological
reasons is unlikely. Intra- or inter-examiner error, however, may occur due to
lack of adherence to the protocol by examiners and changes in quality control
procedures over time. During 1999-2004 and 2011-2016, there were only minor
changes to the dental fluorosis assessment protocol (no dental explorer used
for assessment in 2011-2016) and the QA procedures (repeat examinations by the
same examiner only occurred in 1999-2001). There was no change to the
measurement scale (DFI). This index is, however, known for its subjective
nature, which leads to potential variability, especially at the low end of the
index where distinguishing between very mild (i.e., less than 25% of the
tooth) and mild (25% to less than 50%) can be difficult. Evaluation of gold
standard examinations found that agreement (across 4 different weighting
schemes) ranged from 0.51 to 0.98 for the 9 primary dental examiners in
1999-2016. These values indicate moderate (0.41-0.60) to almost perfect
(0.81-0.99) agreement based on Landis and Koch, and mostly adequate agreement
(33 out 36 kappas >=0.6) based on McHugh. It is possible, however, that the
quantity of repeats as a percentage of the total examined persons (2.8%-3.6%)
was inadequate for making conclusions on the reliability of a tool with such
subjective variability. Additionally, the assessment of intra-examiner
reliability from 1999-2001, as published by Dye et al. (2007), did not show
perfect agreement in scoring of the same person only a few days later
(weighted kappa statistics comparing person-level scores for the same
participant by the same examiner ranged from 0.56 to 0.72). This demonstrates
the substantial subjectivity and variability of this scoring method. There was
no assessment of intra-examiner reliability in 2011-2016, and procedures to
ensure calibration of the reference examiner over time are not available.
Therefore, the possibility of a shift in how the examiners assessed dental
fluorosis over time cannot be ruled out.

The impact of the complex sampling scheme of NHANES and geographic variability
in the presence of fluoride in drinking water on the results were also
evaluated. While there were significant sample design changes between
1999-2004 and 2011-2016, and specifically with the oversampled groups, when
proper weighting procedures are used, the final estimates produced should
still be reflective of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population of
youth aged 6-19 years, and estimates from the different survey periods should
be comparable. There were no changes to the inclusion and exclusion criteria
for the examination for youth aged 6-19 years specifically and no differences
in the percentage of the sample who completed the fluorosis assessment.

Variability in the prevalence of different dental fluorosis severity levels
was seen within each 6-year time period, as well as across the two time
periods. For example, during 1999-2004, questionable fluorosis ranged from
0.4% to 34.6% and during 2011-2016, mild fluorosis prevalence ranged from 9.1%
to 40.4%. The reasons for this variability cannot be determined but likely
include random error, true change in prevalence, or changes in the application
of measurement processes. There may be other factors outside of these that
could also contribute to the variability in 2-year prevalence estimates.

Further analyses of the synthetic birth cohort born in 1992-1998, revealed
that the prevalence of mild or greater fluorosis in the first permanent molars
was 9.5% in youth aged 6-9 years in 2001-2004, but was 46.9% in youth aged
16-19 years in 2011-2014\. This increase does not seem biologically plausible
since fluorosis develops before teeth erupt and therefore prevalence in
erupted teeth for the same birth cohort should not change over time. The
analysis of the synthetic cohort with adjustment for possible changes in the
demographic characteristics of the population over time, suggests that the
observed increase in fluorosis prevalence does not reflect the genuine amount
of change within the U.S. population.
