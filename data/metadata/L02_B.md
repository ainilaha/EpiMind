## Component Description

Hepatitis viruses constitute a major public health problem because of the
morbidity and mortality associated with the acute and chronic consequences of
these infections. New immunization strategies have been developed to eliminate
the spread of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in the United States. Recommendations
have also been developed for the prevention and control of hepatitis C virus
(HCV) infection. Because of the high rate of asymptomatic infection with these
viruses, information about the prevalence of these diseases is needed to
monitor prevention efforts. By testing a nationally representative sample of
the U.S. population, NHANES will provide the most reliable estimates of age-
specific prevalence needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategies to
prevent these infections. In addition, NHANES provides the means to better
define the epidemiology of other hepatitis viruses. NHANES testing for markers
of infection with hepatitis viruses will be used to determine secular trends
in infection rates across most age and racial/ethnic groups, and will provide
a national picture of the epidemiologic determinants of these infections.

## Eligible Sample

**Hepatitis B: core antibody and surface antigen; Hepatitis C: confirmed
antibody and RNA (HCV-RNA); Hepatitis D antibody:** participants aged 6 years
and older are eligible to be tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Hepatitis B Virus Core Antibody**  
Â  
The Ortho HBc ELISA Test System is a qualitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) for the detection of total antibody to anti-HBc in human serum
or plasma. Anti-HBc appears in virtually all individuals infected with HBV and
is an accurate serological marker of current and past infection.  
  
ELISA procedures provide a means for routinely detecting antibodies to
specific antigens. This FDA-licensed method is commercially obtained in kit
form. The literature and instructions with each kit constitute the standard
operating procedure (SOP) for the method.

**Hepatitis B Surface Antigen**  
  
The AUSZYME Monoclonal test is a solid-phase âsandwichâ enzyme
immunoassays used to detect the presence of HBsAg, which indicates current
infection with HBV. Specimens that test nonreactive by the AUSZYME Monoclonal
tests (Abbott Diagnostics) are considered negative for HBsAg and are not
tested further. All specimens considered reactive initially are repeat-tested
in duplicate using the same procedure as that used in the initial test. If
neither of the repeat tests is reactive, the specimen is considered negative
for HBsAg. If the specimen is reactive in either of the repeat tests, the
sample is considered repeatedly reactive.

**Hepatitis C Antibody**  
  
Qualitative determination of the human antibody directed against hepatitis C
virus (anti-HCV) in human serum or plasma is measured using direct solid-phase
enzyme immunoassay with the anti-HCV screening ELISA. Positive specimens are
repeated in duplicate according to the same procedure. Repeatedly positive
specimens are tested supplementally using the Chiron RIBA Processor System
(Chiron Corporation, Inc.). Samples where the RIBA result was positive are
reported as confirmed positive for antibody to HCV Samples where the RIBA
result was negative are reported as negative for antibody to HCV and
indeterminate results are reported as indeterminate.

**The Chiron RIBA HCV 3.0 Strip (confirmation test)**

The Chiron RIBA 3.0 Strip Immunoblot Assay (SIA; Chiron Corporation, Inc.) is
an in vitro qualitative enzyme immunoassay for the detection of antibody to
hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in human serum or plasma.  
Detection of anti-HCV by SIA methodology is based upon traditional Western and
dot blotting techniques, in which specific immunogens (i.e. antigenic
polyproteins) encoded by the HCV genome are immobilized onto a membrane
support. Visualization of anti-HCV reactivity in specimens to the individual
HCV-encoded proteins is accomplished with anti-human IgG enzyme-conjugates in
conjunction with a colorimetric enzyme substrate. Qualitative determination of
the human antibody directed against hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) in human
serum or plasma is measured with a direct solid-phase enzyme immunoassay. A
detailed description of the laboratory method used can be found on the NHANES
website.

**Hepatitis C RNA (HCV-RNA)**  
  
The COBAS AMPLICOR HCV MONITOR Test, version 2 0 (v2.0) is an in vitro nucleic
acid amplification test for the quantitation of Hepatitis C Virus RNA in human
serum or plasma on the COBAS AMPLICOR Analyzer.

**Hepatitis D Antibody**  
  
The International Immunodiagnostics HDV Ab assay is a competitive enzyme
immunoassay (ELISA) for the determination of antibodies to Hepatitis D Virus
or HDV in human plasma and sera with a 'two steps" methodology. Anti-HDV
antibodies, if present in the sample, compete with a virus specific polyclonal
IgG, labeled with peroxidase (HRP), for a fixed amount of rec-HDV coated on
the Microplate, in "two step" incubation. The concentration of the bound
enzyme on the solid phase is inversely proportional to the amount of anti-HDV
antibodies in the sample and its activity is detected by adding the
chromagen/substrate in the second incubation. The concentration of HDV-
specific antibodies in the sample is determined by means of a cut-off value
that allows for the semi-quantitative detection of anti-HDV antibodies.Â

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Viral
Hepatitis, National Center for Infectious Diseases, National Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Detailed specimen collection and processing
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM. Read the LABDOC file for
detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are
described in the Analytic Notes for Data Users section below. Detailed
instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found on the NHANES
website.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols. A detailed description of the quality assurance
and quality control procedures can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. They also contain all
survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups. The
phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and phlebotomy files may
be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.Â  
  
The age ranges and constraints for hepatitis testing are as follows:

  * **Hep B** \- The hepatitis B core antibody test is performed on all examinees 6 years old and older. The surface antigen is tested only when the core antibody test is positive. Participant results are coded positive for surface antigen if the surface antigen test is positive; they are coded negative for surface antigen if the test for surface antigen is negative or if the test for hepatitis B core antibody is negative. 

  * **Hep C** -The screening hepatitis C antibody test is performed on all examinees 6 years old and older. Samples testing positive for anti-HCV by the screening EIA test were tested in the confirmatory RIBA assay for antibody to hepatitis C virus. Samples where the RIBA result was positive are reported as confirmed positive for antibody to HCV. Samples where the RIBA result was negative or indeterminate are reported as negative for antibody to HCV. Samples that tested negative by the screening EIA test were not tested by RIBA. These samples were reported as negative for antibody to HCV. If the antibody to Hepatitis C virus was negative, weakly positive, weakly negative or indeterminate then the confirmatory assay to the antibody to Hepatitis C virus was reported as negative and included with the negatives from the screening assay. Samples where the RIBA result is indeterminate are reported out as such and subsequently tested for HCV RNA to attempt to confirm the infection status of the patient.

  * **Hep D** -The Hepatitis Delta Virus (HDV) is a RNA defective virus and infection with HDV only occurs in the presence of acute or chronic HBV infection. In NHANES, the test for antibody to HDV is performed on participants 6 years of age or older who test positive for hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen. Participant results are coded positive for anti-HDV if the anti-HDV test is positive; they are coded negative if the anti-HDV test is negative, or if they are negative for hepatitis B surface antigen, or if they are negative for hepatitis B core antibody.
