### Aromatic Diamines - Urine (UADM_I)

####  Data File: UADM_I.xpt

##### First Published: October 2018

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Urinary aromatic diamines can be formed from the metabolism of diisocyanates,
which are widely used in the polymer industry, particularly in the production
of polyurethane-based consumer products (e.g., foam cushions, mattresses,
pillows, and car seats), elastomers, coating, and adhesives (Lockey, J. E.,
et. al, 2015).

Diisocyanates may be released into the environment through industrial waste,
and volatilization and degradation of consumer products. Exposure to
diisocyanates can occur through dermal contact, ingestion, and inhalation. All
diisocyanates are classified as skin and respiratory sensitizers (Lockey, J.
E., et. al, 2015; Timchalk, C., et. al, 1994). Exposure to these chemicals can
be lethal when inhaled at high concentrations by sensitized subjects, can
elicit hypersensitivity pneumonitis and accelerated lung function loss, and is
considered one of the most frequently reported causes of occupational asthma
(Lockey, J. E., et. al, 2015; Dykewicz, M. S., 2009; Merget, R., et. al,
2002). In addition, the in vivo hydrolyzed product of diisocyanates (i.e.,
diamines such as 4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane (4MDA), 2,4-Diaminotoluene
(4TDA), 2,6-Diaminotoluene (6TDA), 1,5-Diaminonaphthalene (5NDA), and
p-phenylenediamine (PPDA)) have been reported as hepatotoxic and carcinogenic
in human and animal models (Timchalk, C., et. al, 1994; Report on Carcinogens,
13th ed.; IARC, 1999; McGill, D.B., et. al, 1974).  

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible and participants
aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure for the measurement of urinary
aromatic diamines using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-APCI-
MS/MS). Prior to chromatographic separation, urine samples are hydrolyzed in
0.6 M hydrochloric acid at 80 Â°C for 4 hours. Hydrolyzed samples are passed
through solid phase extraction (SPE) sorbents. Chromatographic separation is
achieved using a reversed phase column with 5 mM ammonium acetate buffer at pH
9.2 (mobile phase A) and 5/95% 100 mM ammonium acetate buffer/acetonitrile
(mobile phase B). The eluent from the column is ionized using an APCI
interface to generate and transmit positive ions into the mass spectrometer.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the 2015-2016 survey cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/labmethods/UADM_I_MET.pdf)
(October 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â20Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Servicesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.  

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Aromatic diamines in urine were measured in a full sample of participants ages
3-5 and a one-third subsample of participants aged 6 years and older. Special
sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2015-2016 Demographics
File ](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DEMO_H.XPT)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in âLCâ (ex., URDAAMLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDAAMLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex.,
URXAAM) provides the analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for urinary aromatic diamines:

**Variable Name** |  **SAS Label** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URX4TDA |  2,4-Diaminotoluene (4TDA) (ng/mL) |  0.640  
URX6TDA |  2,6-Diaminotoluene (6TDA) (ng/mL) |  0.640  
URX4MDA |  4,4'-Diaminodiphenylmethane (4MDA) (ng/mL) |  0.048  
URX5NDA |  1,5-Diaminonaphthalene (5NDA) (ng/mL) |  1.00  
URXPPDA |  p-Phenylenediamine (PPDA) (ng/mL) |  2.00  
  
Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
