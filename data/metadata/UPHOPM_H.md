### Pyrethroids, Herbicides, & Organophosphorus Metabolites - Urine (UPHOPM_H)

####  Data File: UPHOPM_H.xpt

##### First Published: May 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

In 2007, an estimated 857 million pounds of conventional pesticides were used
in the United States (EPA, 2020). Chlorpyrifos was the insecticide used the
most in the agricultural market sector with 7-9 million pounds applied. 2,4-D
was the most used herbicide in the home and garden sector and the commercial
sector, and it was the second most used herbicide in the agricultural sector.
Malathion was the most used insecticide in the commercial sector and the
second most used insecticide in the home and garden sector. Pyrethroids were
the most used insecticides in the home and garden sector. In 2007, the United
States used 22% of all pesticides applied throughout the world. The widespread
use of pesticides and the scientific interest in potential adverse health
effects of pesticides exposure have increased the demand for fast and robust
analytical methods for measuring biomarkers of pesticides.

This component measures urinary concentrations of three organophosphorus
insecticide metabolites: 3,5,6-trichloropyridinol,
2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidiol and para-nitrophenol; three synthetic
pyrethroid metabolites: 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid,
and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid;
and one herbicide: 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Target analytes are extracted and concentrated from the urine matrix using an
automated solid phase extraction system. Selective separation of the analytes
is achieved using high-performance liquid chromatography with a gradient
elution program. Sensitive detection of the analytes is performed by a triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer with a heated electrospray ionization source.
Analytes are identified using the specific m/z ion transition, the retention
time and the ion ratio of the quantification and confirmation m/z ion
transitions. Isotopically labeled internal standards are used for precise and
accurate quantification. The approach followed is a modification of previous
methodology (Beeson et al. 1999; Olsson et al. 2004).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, and lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[UPHOPM Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/UPHOPM-H-
MET-508.pdf) (May 2020)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they were
shipped to Division of Laboratory Sciences for testing.

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al.,
1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Services' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Pyrethroids, Herbicides, & Organophosphorus Metabolites were measured in a
one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights
are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Search/DataPage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in this file.
URXUCR can be found in the data file titled "**Albumin & Creatinine -
Urine**".

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit was constant for the analyte in the data set. Two
variables are provided for this analyte. The variable name ending in "LC"
(ex., URD24DLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection:
the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of detection,
"1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For the
analyte with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (URD24DLC=1),
an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is
the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The
variable prefixed URX (ex., URX24D) provides the analytic result for that
analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ug/L) for Pyrethroids, Herbicides, &
Organophosphorus Metabolites:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URX24D |  2,4-dicholorphenoxyacetic acid |  0.15  
URXCPM |  3,5,6-trichloropyridinol |  0.10  
URX4FP |  4-fluoro-3-phenoxy-benzoic acid |  0.10  
URXOPM |  3-phenoxybenzoic acid |  0.10  
URXOXY |  2-isopropyl-4-methyl-pyrimidinol |  0.10  
URXPAR |  _para_ -Nitrophenol |  0.10  
URXTCC |  _trans_ -dichlorovinyl dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid |  0.60
