### Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (formerly Polyfluoroalkyl
Chemicals - PFC) (PFAS_H)

####  Data File: PFAS_H.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2016

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

**_NOTE: Four additional perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
namely four isomers of PFOA and PFOS, were measured using surplus serum
specimens from NHANES 2013-2014. These isomers data should be used in
conjunction with this dataset (PFAS_H), and can be found in the Perfluoroalkyl
and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) - Linear and Branched PFOS and PFOA
Isomers (SSPFAS_H) dataset on this website. Starting with NHANES 2015-2016,
these isomers will be included with the perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
substances (PFAS) dataset._**

**_You may also use the link below to access the dataset for these isomers:_**

<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/sspfas_h.xpt>

Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used in multiple
commercial applications including surfactants, lubricants, paints, polishes,
food packaging and fire-retarding foams. Certain PFAS are used in the
manufacture of polymers used in many industrial and consumer products,
including soil, stain, grease, and water resistant coatings on textiles and
carpet; uses in the automotive, mechanical, aerospace, chemical, electrical,
medical, and building/construction industries; personal care products; and
non-stick coatings on cookware. Some PFASs are ubiquitous contaminants found
both in humans and animals worldwide.

The calculated sum of isomers in the PFAS (formerly PFC) dataset for the
2013-2014 cycle is comparable to the total levels reported in previous cycles
of NHANES.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Online-solid phase extraction coupled to High Performance Liquid
Chromatography-Turbo Ion Spray ionization-tandem Mass Spectrometry (online
SPE-HPLC-TIS-MS/MS) is used for the quantitative detection of PFAS including
2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),
perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBuS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS),
perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate
(PFDeA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUA), and perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA).
Briefly, after dilution with formic acid, one aliquot of 100 μL of serum is
injected into a commercial column switching system allowing for concentration
and chromatographic separation of the analytes. Detection and quantification
are done using tandem mass spectrometry (Kuklenyik Z, et al. 2005).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

They were no changes to the lab equipment or lab site for this component in
the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle. However, the lab method was changed to include
both linear and branched isomers of PFOS and PFOA. These isomers data can be
found in the Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) - Linear and
Branched PFOS and PFOA Isomers (SSPFAS_H) dataset on this website.

(July 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

****

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) used
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (Westgard et al, 1981; Caudill
et al. 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2013-2014 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample weights**

Serum PFAS were measured in a one third subsample of persons 12 years and
over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data properly.
Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data file and
should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

**** The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014
Demographics File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DEMO_H.XPT)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/FASTQX_H.XPT) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture.

The laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN). **  
**

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "L" (ex., LBDPFHSL) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
LBDPFHSL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt(2)). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBXPFHS) provides the
analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for each PFAS is:

**Analyte** | **Item Id  ** | **LLOD  **  
---|---|---  
 Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXPFHS | 0.10  
 2-(N-Methyl-PFOSA) acetic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXMPAH | 0.10  
 Pefluorodecanoic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXPFDE | 0.10  
 Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXPFBS | 0.10  
 Perfluoroheptanoic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXPFHP | 0.10  
 Perfluorononanoic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXPFNA | 0.10  
 Perfluoroundecanoic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXPFUA | 0.10  
 Perflurododecanoic acid (ng/mL) |  LBXPFDO | 0.10  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/nhanes/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
