### Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), Dibenzofurans (PCDFs) &
Coplanar Polychlorinated Biphenyls (cPCBs) - Pooled Samples (DOXPOL_I)

####  Data File: DOXPOL_I.xpt

##### First Published: July 2024

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans
(PCDFs), and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (cPCBs) [coplanar] are
similar classes of chlorinated aromatic chemicals that are produced as
contaminants or byproducts. They have no known commercial or natural use.
PCDDs and PCDFs, referred to as dioxins, are produced primarily during the
incineration or burning of waste; the bleaching processes used in pulp and
paper mills; and the chemical syntheses of trichlorophenoxyacetic acid,
hexachlorophene, vinyl chloride, trichlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol. Both
the synthesis and heat-related degradation of PCBs will produce PCDF by-
products. PCBs are chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals that were once
synthesized for use as heat-exchanger, transformer, and hydraulic fluids, and
also used as additives to paints, oils, window caulking, and floor tiles.

Production of PCBs peaked in the early 1970s and was banned in the United
States after 1979. Together with the PCDDs and PCDFs, cPCBs are often referred
to as "dioxin-like" chemicals because they act in the body through a similar
mechanism.

In the environment, these dioxin-like chemicals are persistent and usually
occur as a mixture of congeners (i.e., compounds that differ by the numbers
and positions of chlorine atoms attached to the dibenzo-p-dioxin,
dibenzofuran, or biphenyl structures). The general population is exposed to
low levels of these dioxin-like chemicals primarily through ingestion of high-
fat foods, such as dairy products, eggs, and animal fats, and some fish and
wildlife.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The seventeen PCDDs/PCDFs, and three cPCBs were measured in serum by gas
chromatography/isotope-dilution high-resolution mass spectrometry (GC/ID-
HRMS). The analytical method for PCDDs/PCDFs/cPCB is described in Patterson
et. al., 1992 and Turner et. al., 1994.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

MET-508.pdf) (July 2024)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedure Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30ÂºC) conditions until they are
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al.,
1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et. al.,
2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Other data set: Additional PCB congeners are reported under data file name
PCBPOL_I. Among these PCB congeners PCB 105, 114, 118, 156, 157, 167 and 189
has a toxic equivalence factor (TEF) and may be used with this data set for
calculating a total TCDD equivalence.

**Subsample Weights**

PCDDs, PCDFs, and cPCBs were measured in a one-third subsample of participants
12 years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

Samples were pooled in groups of 8 samples per pool within 48 demographic
groups. The analysis of NHANES 2015-2016 pooled-sample data must be conducted
with the basic demographic variables provided in this data file. This pooled-
sample data file cannot be linked to other NHANES 2015-2016 data. Because each
sample person does not have an equal probability of selection, sample
weighting is needed to produce correct population estimates of means,
percentiles, and other descriptive statistics.

The pooled-sample weights required to produce estimates from these data are
included in this data file. The analysis of pooled-samples from survey data is
a relatively new field of study, and there is currently no established method
to produce design effect adjusted variance estimates for these pooled results.
These data cannot be analyzed using software designed for complex surveys
because design features are not available.

**Rationale and Methods Used to Create Pooled Results**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides an ongoing
assessment of the US population's exposure to environmental chemicals by using
biomonitoring in conjunction with CDC's National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of
concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the US
population is a primary objective of CDC's biomonitoring program.
Historically, this characterization has been based on individual measurements
of these compounds in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the
population. Pooling samples allows for larger sample volumes which can result
in lower limits of detection and reduces the number of measurements and costs.
In NHANES 2015-2016, a weighted pooled-sample design was implemented to
facilitate pooling samples before making analytical measurements. Table 1
lists the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names,
common abbreviation, and NHANES variable name for the analytes included in
this data file.

Pools were prepared using serum collected from the eligible sample. Samples
were pooled based on gender, race and Hispanic origin, and age. To implement
the pooled-sample design, each participant sample was identified as belonging
to one of 48 demographic groups based on race and Hispanic origin (Mexican
American: MA, Other Hispanic: OH, non-Hispanic white: NHW, non-Hispanic black:
NHB, non-Hispanic Asian: NHA, Other race including multiracial: OTHER), gender
(Male, Female), and age group (12-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years of age and
older). Eight (8) samples were included in each pool. The number of pools
created for each of the 48 demographic groups varied depending on the total
number of individual samples available in a demographic group.The one-third
subset of NHANES 2015-2016 represents 2,133 individual samples, but because
the pooled-sample design requires that all samples be of sufficient volume and
that there be the same number of samples in each pool, 1,989 samples were
available to create 265 pools with 8 samples per pool. For NHANES 2015-2016,
due to limited sample size, no pooled sample was formed for females 60 years
and older in the "OTHER" race/Hispanic origin group. Data user needs to be
cautious when making national inference including this population subgroup.
See more details on pool sample formation and exceptions in Table 2. The
variable SAMPLEID denotes the identification number for each pool and ranges
from 1 through 265. Please refer to the Pooled-Sample Technical Support file
(POOLTF_I) for detailed information on individual participants included in
each pool.

In order to incorporate sample weighting into the pooled-sample design it was
necessary to use a different volume of material from each sample contributing
to a pool. The volume chosen for each sample in a pool was based on the ratio
of its sampling weight to the sum of the sampling weights of all samples in
the pool. To physically accomplish the pooling in the laboratory required that
the ratio of the largest to the smallest sampling weight of samples in the
same pool be no larger than about 4 or 5. The individual samples were
sorted/stratified by sampling weight within each of the 48 demographic groups
and pools were formed using samples with sampling weights adjacent to one
another in the sorted list. The number of samples in the one-third subset,
number of samples available, the number of these samples that were usable, and
the number of pools formed in each demographic group are presented in Table 2.
Once the pools were created, summed sampling weights were further adjusted to
account for the unused samples. These adjusted summed sampling weights are
represented by the variable named WTSMSMPA.

**Detection Limits**

In the dataset, the whole-weight detection limit (fg/g serum) is a variable
and dependent on the available sample size; however, the variation in sample
size was low. Lipid adjusted detection limits are variable (pg/g lipid) due to
differences of the lipid levels measured in individual pools/specimens. In
cases where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that
variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of 2.

**Methodological approaches for analysis**

There are a few pooled-sample methodological publications which address
approaches related to the following topics:

    â¢ Variance estimation and bias correction when pooling samples from log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2010b; Caudill et. al., 2007; Li et. al., 2014); 

    â¢ Models that incorporate measurement error when analyzing pooled-samples from normally or log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2015); 

    â¢ Incorporation of sample weighting into a pooled-sample design (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a); 

    â¢ Estimation of standard errors and confidence limits for point estimates from pooled-samples (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a).
