### Autoantibodies - Immunofluorescence & Immunoprecipitation Analyses
(Surplus) (SSANA_A)

####  Data File: SSANA_A.xpt

##### First Published: June 2011

##### Last Revised: July 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed.

immunoprecipitation analyses of autoantibodies (Revised January 2012)

## Component Description

IgG autoantibody testing of a subsample stored serum of specimens from NHANES
(1999-2004) was conducted to estimate the prevalence and specificities of
selected autoantibodies in the US population in 1999-2004.

## Eligible Sample

One third subsample of participants aged 12 years and older from NHANES
1999-2004 in the Dioxin subsample who had stored sera (total of N = ~5,000
from NHANES 1999-2004).

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Immunofluorescence analysis  
Testing of IgG autoantibodies to human cellular antigens was performed by the
HEp-2 cell immunofluorescence assay using slides from INOVA Diagnostics, San
Diego, CA (Cat # 508100) following the manufacturerâs instructions.

The cellular pattern of staining and its staining intensity from 0 to 4+ was
described using a reference gallery per below. The determination of
autoantibody titers from 1:80 to 1:1280 was performed by serial dilution on
samples that showed a 3+ or greater nuclear and/or cytoplasmic
immunofluorescence pattern.

Immunoprecipitation analysis  
Testing of IgG autoantibodies to human cellular antigens was performed on
samples that showed a 3+ or greater immunofluorescence staining using
immunoprecipitation assays by a standard method (Reeves WH,et al., 2006)

Sera that showed known autoantibody specificities based on visible
immunoprecipitated protein bands consistent with the combination of bands and
their estimated size per the table below were recorded. Immunoprecipitated
ribonucleic acid bands on stained gels were also recorded when they were
needed to confirm the specificity. When necessary, the size and the pattern of
migration were compared with reference sera (Reeves WH,et al., 2006).

## Data Processing and Editing

Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Immunofluorescence analysis  
Serum samples were tested using established protocols outlined by
manufacturer. A set of CDC autoimmune reference sera (12 different
specificities) (Chan EKL et al., 2007) and 2 healthy control sera were coded
and tested in a blinded fashion two times to verify consistent results
throughout screening test: towards the beginning and when approximately half
of the samples were tested.

Samples that showed discrepant results were repeated.

More than every 50th sample (2% of the total from NHANES 1999-2004) was
automatically repeated to assess assay precision issues. Additional samples
were repeated for the following reasons:  
1) Titering of 3+/4+ positive samples (repeat, n=692)  
2) Randomly selected samples for titering (and repeat, n=1035)  
3) Other repeats are performed whenever there is any doubt for accuracy or
technical issues. Samples repeated with 2 independent staining = 895; 3
independent staining = 194; 4 independent staining = 4.

Immunoprecipitation analysis  
Serum samples were tested using the standard immunoprecipitation protocol
(Reeves WH,et al., 2006). A set of CDC autoimmune reference sera (12
specificities) and 2 healthy controls were tested in a blinded fashion two
times to verify consistent results throughout screening test: towards the
beginning of the study and when approximately half of the samples were tested.

Samples that showed common bands were repeated in parallel side-by-side
fashion for comparison with each other and with known controls as needed.

Assay reproducibility was initially assessed by random selection of the ANA 3+
or 4+ sera number of serum specimens tested and repeating the
immunoprecipitation assay. The percentage of samples that were repeated was
actually 15% (103/692) of the sera tested by IP.Â Â

## Analytic Notes

The NHANES Survey Design:  
  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data should be conducted using the key
survey design variables. The NHANES Demographic data files for each 2-year
survey cycle contain core information on the survey and the survey design
variables for strata and PSU (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) which are
recommended to be used in variance estimation. This laboratory data files may
be linked to other NHANES data files using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.  
  
Weighting:  
  
Special subsample sample weights WTANA6YR in the file are required to analyze
the NHANES 1999-2004 ANA data. This is because the ANA data were analyzed
using stored serum samples obtained from survey participants who had been
selected from NHANES 1999-2004 Dioxin subsamples. The NHANES 1999-2004 ANA
sample and the subsample weights were created for 6 years analysis and should
be used to analyze all six years together.
