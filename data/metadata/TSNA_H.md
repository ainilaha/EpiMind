### Tobacco-specific Nitrosamines (TSNAs) - Urine (TSNA_H)

####  Data File: TSNA_H.xpt

##### First Published: April 2019

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The specific aims of the component are: 1) to measure the prevalence and
extent of tobacco use; 2) to estimate the extent of exposure to environmental
tobacco smoke (ETS), and determine trends in exposure to ETS; and 3) to
describe the relationship between tobacco use (as well as exposure to ETS) and
chronic health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) are formed during tobacco smoking and
tobacco curing. TSNAs are a leading class of carcinogens in tobacco products,
thus becoming an important class of biomarkers for tobacco carcinogen uptake
(Hecht and Hoffman, Carcinogenesis; International Agency for Research on
Cancer, IARC; Shah and Karnes, Critical Reviews in Toxicology). There are
seven major TSNAs identified from tobacco smoke, which includes
4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK),
4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), N'-nitrosonornicotine
(NNN), N'-nitrosoanatabine (NAT) and N'-nitrosoanabasine (NAB). Due to their
specificity to tobacco, the study of TSNA uptake will provide very useful
insight into the mechanistic and epidemiologic role of these compounds in
human cancer.

NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) is a significant
component of tobacco and tobacco smoke. In the smoker's body, NNK is rapidly
reduced to its metabolite, NNAL
(4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanonol). A significant portion of
NNAL may also exist in the glucuronide form NNAL-Gluc (NNAL-N-Gluc and NNAL-O-
Gluc) in the urine. Both NNK and NNAL are potent lung carcinogens in rodents
(Smith C. J. and Hansch C., Food and Chemical Toxicology), and are likely
involved in the increased lung cancer risk in smokers (Hecht S. S. and
Hoffmann D., Carcinogenesis; Hecht, Chem. Res.Toxicol; Preston-Martin, S, IARC
Sci. Publ.) NNAL has similar carcinogenicity to NNK (Hecht, S. S.,
Carcinogenesis). NNAL (either free and/or total forms) may be used as a
biomarker for exposure to NNK among active smokers, and among nonsmokers
following exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS).  

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Tobacco-specific nitrosamines in urine are measured by an isotope-dilution
high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (ID HPLC-ESI MS/MS). For "total" TSNA assays, the urine sample is
fortified with internal standards, and then hydrolyzed using β-glucuronidase
in incubations for at least 24 hours. The samples are then extracted with
liquid-liquid extraction followed by solid phase extraction, after which the
analyte is eluted and analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The m/z 210/180, 210/93, and
216/186 are monitored for NNAL quantitation, confirmation, and ISTD,
respectively. The m/z 178/148, 178/105, and 182/152 are monitored for NNN
quantitation, confirmation, and ISTD, respectively. The m/z 190/160, 190/106,
and 194/164 are monitored for NAT quantitation, confirmation, and ISTD,
respectively. The m/z 192/162, 192/106, and 196/166 are monitored for NAB
quantitation, confirmation, and ISTD, respectively. The concentrations are
derived from their respective ratios of native to isotope-labeled in the
sample by comparing to their standard curves. Free TSNA measurements are
conducted in a similar manner, but with the omission of prior enzymatic
hydrolysis.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle. NNAL has been removed
from the COTNAL dataset from previous cycles and included in this new dataset.

Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/TSNA_H_MET.pdf)
(April 2019)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they were
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.  

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on
the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  

The laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDNALLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXNAL) provides the analytic
result for the analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex. URDNALLC =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ng/mL) for Tobacco-Specific Nitrosamines
(TSNA) in urine:

**VARIABLE** |  **SAS LABEL** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URXNAL |  Urinary Total NNAL (ng/mL) |  0.0006  
URXNAB |  N'-Nitrosanabasine (NAB), urine (ng/mL) |  0.0016  
URXNAT |  N'-Nitrosanatabine (NAT), urine (ng/mL) |  0.0042  
URXNNN |  N'-Nitrosonornicotine (NNN), urine (ng/mL) |  0.0028
