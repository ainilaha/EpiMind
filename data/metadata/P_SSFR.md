### Flame Retardants - Urine (Surplus) (P_SSFR)

####  Data File: P_SSFR.xpt

##### First Published: January 2024

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Flame retardants (FRs) are either additive or reactive ingredients applied to
household and consumer products to reduce the products flammability and to
meet state and federal fire safety standards and regulations. Until recently,
a dominant class of FR additives used for household products was
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), which are persistent and can
accumulate in the environment (de Wit, 2002; Law et. al., 2006; Stapleton et.
al., 2012). Flame retardant formulations containing chlorinated and non-
chlorinated organophosphates and non-PBDE brominated chemicals have entered
consumers' markets as PBDEs have been phased-out in many countries (van der
Veen and de Boer, 2012). Several organophosphate aryl ester technical mixtures
have been increasingly used in residential applications. These mixtures
contain isomers of isopropylated and tert-butylated triarylphosphate esters,
such as isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphate and tert-butylphenyl diphenyl
phosphate (Phillips et. al., 2017). Additionally, human exposure to these
mixtures has been demonstrated to be widespread in several studies (Hammel et.
al., 2016; Phillips et. al., 2018). Biomarkers of exposure of several flame
retardants are quantified here, including 2-((isopropyl)phenyl)phenyl
phosphate (iPPPP) and 4-((tert-butyl)phenyl)phenyl phosphate (tBPPP), two
metabolites of isopropylphenyl diphenyl phosphates and tert-butylphenyl
diphenyl phosphates, respectively.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and participants aged 6 years and
older from a one-third subsample in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic
sample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The method uses 0.2 mL urine and is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of urinary
conjugates of the target analytes, automated off-line solid phase extraction,
reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography separation, and isotope
dilution-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry detection
(Jayatilaka et. al., 2019).

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 cycle.  

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The analytical measurements were conducted following strict quality
control/quality assurance CLIA guidelines. Along with the study samples, each
analytical run included high- and low-concentration quality control materials
(QCMs) and reagent blanks to assure the accuracy and reliability of the data.
The concentrations of the high-concentration QCMs and the low-concentration
QCMs, averaged to obtain one measurement of high-concentration QCM and low-
concentration QCM for each run, were evaluated using standard statistical
probability rules (Caudill et. al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all analyses were complete. The data were not edited.
The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from surplus specimens from
the previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data
file. A special weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic data file. The resulting sample weights in the present file should be
used to calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are
not appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not
yield nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or
the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for
additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and
for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that
2-year cycle.

Laboratory Data Overviews for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. Additionally, availability of specimens for surplus projects
is lower than for other laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The
specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for details on the use
of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in all examined
participants aged 3-5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample, WTSSBPP, are included in
this data file and should be used when analyzing these data. The sample
weights created for this file used the examination sample weight, i.e.,
WTMECPRP, as the base weight. The base weight was adjusted for additional
nonresponse to these lab tests and re-poststratified to the population total
using sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin. Participants who were part of the
eligible population but did not provide a urine specimen, or did not have
sufficient volume of biospecimens, or who did not give consent for their
specimens to be used for future research are included in the file; however,
they have a sample weight assigned "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The variable URXUCR (urine creatinine) will not be reported in this file.
URXUCR can be found in the data file titled "Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit was constant for all of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in
"L" (ex., SSIPPPL) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable (ex., SSIPPP) provides the analytic result for that analyte.
For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
SSIPPPL=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt[2]). All data are rounded to three significant figures or three
decimal places, whichever is less precise.

The lower limits of detection (LLOD, in µg/mL) for SSIPPP and SSBPPP:

Variable Name | Analyte Description | LLOD  
---|---|---  
SSIPPP | 2-((isopropyl)phenyl)phenyl phosphate (µg/L) | 0.05  
SSBPPP | 4-((tert-butyl)phenyl)phenyl phosphate (µg/L) | 0.05
