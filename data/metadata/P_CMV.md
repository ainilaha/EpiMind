## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a herpes virus, which can be a serious pathogen in
infants and adults.  CMV usually does not cause significant disease in healthy
individuals, but pregnant women can transmit CMV to their unborn babies, who
are then at risk. Congenital CMV infection is a significant source of
morbidity among children, causing a wide range of clinical outcomes including
jaundice, hydrocephalia, hearing loss, ocular lesions, and even death.
Currently, about one out of every 200 babies are born with congenital CMV
infection each year.

In the United States, one in three children are already infected with CMV by
age five. Young children with CMV infection shed the virus in high titers and
are a major source of transmission to other susceptible children and adults,
which is of special concern for pregnant women. For this reason,
characterizing infection among children less than 6 years old is essential to
expanding our understanding of important transmission exposures, mainly
breastfeeding and close contact during childcare, and patterns of primary and
recurrent infections. Such information would inform the development of
prevention strategies to protect vulnerable populations, including pregnant
women and their fetuses.

Additionally, young children have been identified as a potential target
population for CMV vaccine development, recently ranked of highest priority by
the Institute of Medicine. Describing the serological profile of children
under the age of 6 would improve our understanding of immunity during early
childhood and facilitate vaccine development.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 1 to 5 years, in the NHANES 2017-March 2020
pre-pandemic sample, were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

CMV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are detected by enzyme-linked
fluorescent immunoassay (ELFA) in a semiquantitative-automated manner, using
the VIDAS CMV method designed by Biomerieux. All NHANES specimen numbers were
scanned by the barcode reader. The VIDAS instrument reads the specimen
reactivity of each sample and assigns numeric values.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the National Center for
Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA
for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing instructions are
discussed in the [NHANES 2017-2018
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)and
[2019-2020 Laboratory Procedures Manuals
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-Laboratory-
Procedures-Manual-508.pdf)(LPMs).  Vials were stored under appropriate frozen
(-30oC) conditions until they were shipped to the National Center for
Infectious Diseases for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPMs](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et al. 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed.  Incomplete data and improbable values were sent to
the performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not appropriate
for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Refer to the [2017-2018
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)and
[2019-2020 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
documents for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2019-2020, approximately 71% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 94% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the on-line
NHANES [Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
details on the use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [2017-March2020 Pre-pandemic
Demographics File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

Since this data is reported as qualitative data, the use of lower limit of
detections (LLODs) isn't applicable.
