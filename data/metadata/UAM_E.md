### Atrazine and Metabolites (UAM_E)

####  Data File: UAM_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2015

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Atrazine is a widely used chlorotriazine herbicide, active against broadleaf
and grassy weeds, and applied both pre-and post-emergent to agricultural land
for crops such as corn and sorghum. It is also used as a non-selective
herbicide. In areas where atrazine is used, it may be detected pesticides in
surface and ground waters. Atrazine does not bioaccumulate, but it degrades
slowly in soils to dealkylated products, which may last for several months.
Atrazine use has been progressively restricted because of concerns that
drinking water sources may become contaminated. Human exposure may be
evaluated by measuring urinary metabolites, but the dealkylated metabolites
can result from metabolism of other chlorotriazine herbicides, including
simazine, propazine, cyanazine. The dealkylated atrazine metabolites and
hydroxyatrazine can also occur in the environment from breakdown of atrazine.
Therefore, detection of the dealkylated metabolites in urine may reflect
exposure to atrazine, another chlorotriazine herbicide, environmental
breakdown products of one or more chlorotriazine herbicides, or any
combination of these. Because atrazine is widely used in the U.S., measuring
urinary atrazine and its metabolites is important to evaluate human exposure
and potential for health effects.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. Vials are stored under
appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are shipped to National
Center for Environmental Health for testing.

 Atrazine (6-chloro N-ethyl-N'-(1-methylethyl)-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine; CAS
Number: 1912-24-9; AAZ) is a triazine herbicide used to kill weeds, primarily
on crops such as sugarcane, corn, pineapples, sorghum, and macadamia nuts. It
has also been used on evergreen tree farms, evergreen forest re-growth,
highway and railroad rights-of-way, and turf application. Atrazine was the
most used active ingredient in agriculture in the United States for nearly two
decades, until it was replaced by glyphosate . Regardless, the amount of
atrazine applied annually has remained relatively constant with tens of
million pounds applied annually in the United States.

AAZ enters into the environment, particularly soil and water. Its primary
degradation can occur via soil bacteria and abiotic processes with an
environmental half-life of a few weeks to several months (ATSDR 200. AAZ and
its degradation products tend to migrate out of the soil into water systems
including surface runoff to streams, river, and lakes, or deep ground water
systems and aquifers creating a potential for human exposure.

The AAZ metabolism may differ based on the exposure scenario. Occupational
exposures may result in increased exposure to atrazine itself while
environmental exposures are likely dominated by the dealkylated environmental
degradates which are presumed to be biologically active if they retain the
chlorine atom. Thus, measurement of multiple potential metabolites is
necessary to best assess exposures to atrazine and its related degradates.

The method uses solid phase extraction coupled with high performance liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SPE-HPLC-MS/MS) for quantifying
atrazine and its metabolites and/or hydrolysis products. The method relies on
automated off-line SPE to pre-concentrate the target compounds while reducing
or eliminating most of the urine matrix potential interferences to increase
the overall sensitivity and specificity. Off-line SPE is coupled with on-line
two-dimensional (2D) HPLC combining cation exchange (SCX) and reversed phase
(RP) chromatography in one integrated HPLC system followed by isotope dilution
tandem mass spectrometry for the quantitative determination of the target
analytes. Also, for high exposure studies (i.e., animal toxicology) all target
compounds can be measured by injecting a small amount (10 µl) of sample
directly into the HPLC-MS/MS system without a pre-concentration step.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found in
the [NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2007-2008/manuals/manual_lab.pdf).

Refer to NHANES 2007 - 2008 Lab Methods for Atrazine and metabolites
laboratory for a detailed description of the laboratory method used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2007-2008/manuals/manual_lab.pdf).

Read the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2007)
file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the [General Documentation on Laboratory
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2007)
file for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical
methods are described in the Description of Laboratory Methodology section
above.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2007-2008 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2007)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample weights:**

Atrazine and metabolites were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**  NHANES Survey Design:**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES 2007-2008 Demographics
File contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews as well as the sample design
variables. The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of
stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the
demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits:**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URDATZLC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1." "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (i.e., URDATZLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]).

The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD in ug/L) for the atrazine and metabolites
is:

**Variable Name** | **  SAS Label** | **  LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URXAAZ | Atrazine | 0.5000  
URXATZ | Atrazine mercapturate (ug/L) | 0.5000  
URXDCZ | Diaminochloroatrazine(ug/L) | 0.5000  
URXDTZ | Desethyl atrazine(ug/L) | 0.2500  
URXSIS | Desisopropyl atrazine(ug/L) | 0.2500  
URXSISM | Desisopropyl atrazine mercapturate(ug/L) | 0.1000
