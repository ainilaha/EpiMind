## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

**Lead**

Lead is a known environmental toxin that has been shown to affect
deleteriously the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and reproductive
systems. In young children, lead exposure is a particular hazard because
children more readily absorb lead than adults, and children's developing
nervous systems also make them more susceptible to the effects of lead. The
primary sources of exposure for children are lead-laden paint chips and dust
as a result of deteriorating lead-based paint. The risk for lead exposure is
disproportionately higher for children who are poor, non-Hispanic black,
living in large metropolitan areas, or living in older housing. Among adults,
the most common high exposure sources are occupational. Blood lead levels
measured in previous NHANES cycles have been the cornerstone of lead exposure
surveillance in the U.S. The data have been used to document the burden and
dramatic decline of elevated blood lead levels, to promote the reduction of
lead use, and to help to redefine national lead poisoning prevention
guidelines, standards, and abatement activities.

**Cadmium**

Blood cadmium reflects both recent and cumulative exposures. Cadmium is
absorbed via inhalation and ingestion. Occupational exposure is the most
common cause of elevated cadmium levels. Inhalation of cigarette smoke is a
predominant source of exposure in smokers whose blood cadmium levels have been
observed to be about twice as high compared to nonsmokers. For nonsmokers who
are not exposed to cadmium in the workplace, ingestion through food is the
largest source of exposure. With chronic exposure, cadmium accumulates in the
liver and kidneys where it is bound to metallothionein, an inducible metal
binding protein. The kidney is a critical target and shows the earliest sign
of cadmium toxicity. Cadmium can produce lung, pituitary gland and kidney
tumors in animals and has been associated with lung cancer in humans in
occupational epidemiologic studies. Both International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) consider cadmium a human
carcinogen.

**Manganese**

The greatest demand for manganese is for the production of iron and steel. In
addition, it is a key component of low-cost stainless steel and certain
aluminum alloys. At low concentrations, it is used to decolorize glass, while
at higher concentrations; it is used to make violet-colored glass. Manganese
dioxide, besides being a useful pigment, is a catalyst and a component of
certain dry cell batteries. Potassium permanganate is a potent oxidizer and
disinfectant. Manganese (in the form of manganese ions) is an essential trace
nutrient in all known forms of life. On the other hand, excess manganese is
toxic.

**Total Mercury**

Uncertainties exist regarding levels of exposure to methyl mercury from fish
consumption and potential health effects resulting from this exposure. Past
estimates of exposure to methyl mercury have been obtained from results of
food consumption surveys and measures of methyl mercury in fish. Measures of a
biomarker of exposure are needed for improved exposure assessments. Blood
mercury levels will be assessed in two subpopulations particularly vulnerable
to the health effects from mercury exposure: children 1-5 years old and women
of childbearing age. Blood measures of total and inorganic mercury will be
important for evaluation of exposure from exposure to mercury in interior
latex paints.

**Selenium**

Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for
cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is a
component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin
reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and
some plants). It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes, which convert one
thyroid hormone to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species,
with some plants requiring relatively large amounts, and others apparently
requiring none.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 1 year and older in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-
pandemic sample were eligible. Due to disclosure concern, blood lead data from
participants aged 1-5 years may only be accessed through the [NCHS Research
Data Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc). Blood lead data from participants aged
6 years and older, and blood cadmium, manganese, total mercury, and selenium
data from all examined participants 1 years and older are included in this
dataset. See Analytic Notes for additional information on blood lead data from
participants aged 1-5 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method directly measures lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), total mercury (Hg),
manganese (Mn), and selenium (Se) content of whole blood specimens using mass
spectrometry after a simple dilution sample preparation step.

During the sample dilution step, a small volume of whole blood is extracted
from a larger whole blood patient specimen after the entire specimen is mixed
(vortexed) to create a uniform distribution of cellular components. This
mixing step is important because some metals (e.g., Pb) are known to be
associated mostly with the red blood cells in the specimen and a uniform
distribution of this cellular material must be produced before a small volume
extracted from the larger specimen will accurately reflect the average metal
concentration of all fractions of the larger specimen. Coagulation is the
process in which blood forms solid clots from its cellular components. If
steps are not taken to prevent this process from occurring, i.e., addition of
anti-coagulant reagents such as EDTA in the blood collection tube prior to
blood collection, blood will immediately begin to form clots once leaving the
body and entering the tube. These clots prevent the uniform distribution of
cellular material in the blood specimen even after rigorous mixing, making a
representative sub-sample of the larger specimen unattainable. It is important
that prior to or during sample preparation the analyst identify any sample
having clots or micro-clots (small clots). Clotted samples are not analyzed by
this method due to the inhomogeneity concerns (i.e., all results for the
sample are processed as "not reportable").

Liquid samples are introduced into the mass spectrometer through the
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ionization source. The liquid diluted blood
sample is forced through a nebulizer with argon gas, which converts the bulk
liquid into an aerosol of small droplets. The smaller droplets in the aerosol
are selectively passed through the spray chamber by a flowing argon stream
into the 6000-8000K plasma of the ICP. The high energy of the plasma results
in the ionization of the atoms of lead, cadmium, mercury, manganese, and
selenium from the droplets from the sample. The ions enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the atmospheric pressure,
~760 torr, of the ICP from the vacuum region, ~10-5 torr, within the mass
spectrometer. After the interface, the ions pass through a focusing region,
then the first quadrupole mass filter (Q1), the collision-reaction cell (or
octopole reaction system, ORS), a second quadrupole mass filter (Q2), and
finally are selectively counted in rapid sequence of mass-to-charge ratios at
the detector.

Electrical signals associated with each mass-to-charge ratio monitored are
summed by a computer, and the magnitude of the signals detected while
aspirating an unknown sample is correlated to an elemental concentration
through comparison of the blank-subtracted analyte / internal standard signal
ratio of the unknown sample with the signal ratio obtained when aspirating
calibrators. This method was originally based on the method by Jones (Jones,
et al., 2017).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used. There was a change to the method between the
2017-2018 and the 2019-March 2020 cycles.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf) NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manuals
(LPMs). Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until
they are shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPMs.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  
  
NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.  
  
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences QA/QC performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the
Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Five additional variables were created for this data file. The variables were
created using the following formulas:

**LBDBCDSI:**   The analyte cadmium value in µg/L (LBXBCD) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDBCDSI) by multiplying LBXBCD by 8.897 (Round 3 decimal points).

**LBDBPBSI:**   The analyte lead value in µg/dL (LBXBPB) was converted to
µmol/L (LBDBPBSI) by multiplying LBXBPB by 0.0483 (Round 3 decimal points).

**LBDBMNSI:**   The analyte manganese value in µg/L (LBXBMN) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDBMNSI) by multiplying LBXBMN by 18.202 (Round 2 decimal points).

**LBDBSESI:**   The analyte selenium value in µg/L (LBXBSE) was converted to
µmol/L (LBDBSESI) by multiplying LBXBSE by 0.0127 (Round 2 decimal points).

**LBDTHGSI:**   The analyte mercury value in µg/L (LBXTHG) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDTHGSI) by multiplying LBXTHG by 4.99 (Round 2 decimal points).

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the demographic data file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These sample weights are not
appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield
nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the
2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional
information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the
previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year
cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and
[2019-2020](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
Laboratory Data Overview documents for general information on NHANES
laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in, 2017-March 2020 approximately 76%
of children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [2017-March 2020 Pre-Pandemic
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2017-2018/P_FASTQX.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The change in methods between the 2017-2018 and 2019-March 2020 cycles
resulted in different lower detection limits between the data obtained in the
2019-March 2020 and those in the 2017-2018 survey cycle. In order to make the
merged dataset compatible the higher detection limit of the two methods for
each analyte was used for both cycles. Two variables are provided for each of
these analytes. The variable name ending in "LC" (ex., LBDBCDLC) indicates
whether the result was below the limit of detection: the value "0" means that
the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. The other variable prefixed LBX (ex.,
LBXBCD) provides the analytic result for the analyte. For analytes with
analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex. LBDBCDLC=1), an
imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the
lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for cadmium, manganese, total
mercury and selenium, and (LLOD, in ug/dL) for lead in the present dataset
are:  

Variable Name | Analyte Description | LLOD  
---|---|---  
LBXBCD | Cadmium, blood | 0.100  
LBXBPB | Lead, blood | 0.070  
LBXMN | Manganese, blood | 0.99  
LBXTHG | Mercury, total, blood | 0.28  
LBXBSE | Selenium, blood | 24.48  
  
**Data Access**

Blood Lead data for youth aged 1-5 years are included in file "Lead - Blood -
Youth (P_PBY_R)", and available through the [NCHS Research Data
Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc).
