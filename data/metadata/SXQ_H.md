# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2013-2014 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Sexual Behavior (SXQ_H)

####  Data File: SXQ_H.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2015

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The ACASI section on sexual behavior (variable name prefix SXQ) provides
information on lifetime and current sexual behavior for both men and women.
Major items in this section include age at first sexual intercourse, number of
sexual partners, sexual orientation, circumcision status (men) and history of
sexually transmitted diseases.

## Eligible Sample

Survey participants aged 14-69 years were eligible. Several questions in this
section are age and gender-specific. Mentally impaired individuals or
participants who were unable to understand English, Spanish, Korean,
Vietnamese, or Chinese (traditional/mandarin, simplified/mandarin, and
traditional/Cantonese) were not asked these questions. Only data from
participants aged 18-69 years are included in this release. Special use data
files for participants 14-17 years are available through the NCHS Research
Data Center.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The sexual behavior questionnaire was self-administered in a private room at
the examination center, using the Audio Computer Assisted Self Interview
(ACASI) system. The ACASI was conducted in one of the following languages:
English, Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, or Chinese (traditional/Mandarin,
simplified/Mandarin, and traditional/Cantonese). The ACASI enables respondents
to hear questions through earphones as well as read questions on the computer
screen. Respondents move at their own speed and touch the screen to indicate
their response. No proxy respondents or translators were used in situations
when the respondents could not self-report. The questionnaire is located on
the NHANES website at:  
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/questionnaires/sxq_acasi_h.pdf
>[  
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/questionnaires/sxq_acasi_h.pdf
)

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

For details on the QA/QC process for this component, please refer to the MEC
Interview Manual on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

The sexual behavior questionnaire in 2013-2014 is the same as in 2011-2012 and
2009-2010. However, analyst should be cautious when combining data with cycles
prior to the NHANES 2009-2010 SXQ data, since some questions have been removed
or added, and some questions have had slight wording changes. Please see
Appendix 1 (for male) and Appendix 2 (for female) for detailed information on
variables included in the SXQ section in the latest six release cycles.

The variable SXD021 (Ever had vaginal, anal, or oral sex) was derived from
whether or not the respondent had reported having any of the specific types of
sex. For example, if a male answered "yes" to having had any of the following
types of sex: SXQ800 (Ever had vaginal sex with a woman), SXQ803 (Ever
performed oral sex on a woman), SXQ806 (Ever had anal sex with a woman), or
SXQ809 (Ever had any sex with a man; anal, oral); he would be coded as a "1"
or "yes" in SXD021.

Responses to SXD031 (age at first sexual intercourse), SXD633 (age first
performed oral sex on a woman), and SXD621 (age when first had oral sex) that
were 9 years or less were grouped and coded as "9 years or younger."

Information was collected using two-part (number and unit) questions for both
SXD630 (last performed oral sex on a new male partner) and SXD642 (last
performed oral sex on a new female partner). This is to allow participants to
report how long ago they had performed oral sex either in days, weeks, months,
or years. The released variables were edited to standardize the reported
length of time to number of days, using the following conversion factors: 7
days per week, 30.4 days per month, and 365.25 days per year.

In general, if a person wasn't asked a question, the response to the question
is shown as "missing." It is up to the analysts to recode the response to zero
as they see fit. For example, if a respondent reported that they had zero
lifetime vaginal sex partners, they wouldn't be asked the number of vaginal
sex partners in the past 12 months. Since the respondent does not receive the
question about partners in the past 12 months, the data will be coded as
missing for this variable. Analysts may want to recode this to "0."

For questions that ascertain total number of partners for all types of sex
(i.e., SXD171, SXD510, SXD101 and SXD450), if the respondent had reported
never having any type of sex, the responses were coded as "0."

## Analytic Notes

Beginning in 2013, NHANES started asking participants who answered yes to
having been told by a doctor or other health care professional that they had
genital warts, how old they were when they were first told that they had
genital warts.

Analyst should keep in mind that respondents aged 60-69 years get asked only
some questions. It is important to refer to the codebook to see the target age
for each question.

Although the ACASI has many advantages over interviewer-administered
questionnaires for sensitive information, inconsistent responses can occur.
Since the questionnaire is self-administered, unlikely answers or confusing
questions cannot be clarified by the interviewer. Although, the questionnaire
was programmed to alert respondents of potential data entry errors or
inconsistencies, not every possible consistency check was added. To minimize
potential respondent frustration and confusion, the interview was not
interrupted each time an inconsistent answer occurred in terms of the number
of sexual partners for different periods of recall for different types of
sexual behavior.

Users are cautioned about the use of SXQ292 and SXQ294 in analyses, especially
in analyses that classify respondents by their responses to these questions to
describe or compare subgroup characteristics. The sample size for the non-
heterosexual subgroups is limited and do not meet the minimum sample size
requirements for statistical reliability as noted in the NHANES analytic
guidelines. Even after combining multiple years of data, which is often
recommended to estimate rarer conditions within a subgroup, the non-
heterosexual subgroups do not meet the minimum sample size. Additionally,
there is a high rate of not selecting a specific answer to the questions. That
is, selecting 'don't know', 'refused', 'not sure' or 'something else' as a
response. This issue has been examined at length at the NCHS Questionnaire
Design Research Laboratory (QDRL) recently. Individuals select these answers
for a variety of reasons that are well summarized in the report Design,
Development and Testing of the NHIS Sexual Identity Question, specifically in
Table 21. For example, respondents from the LGBT community select "something
else" when they use a different sexual identity label than those presented in
the response options. However, those who aren't part of the LGBT community
select this answer because they are not familiar with what the response
options mean.

Analysts should be aware that the 2013-2014 sexual behavior data has some
inconsistencies in terms of number of partners reported for each type of sex.
For example, about 1.8% of males and 1.0% of females reported a greater number
of vaginal sex partners in the past 12 months compared with number of "total"
sex partners in the past 12 months.

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the [NHANES
Analytic Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)
and the on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

Special use data files for participants 14-17 years is available through the
NCHS Research Data Center (RDC).
