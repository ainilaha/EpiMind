### Aldehydes - Serum (ALD_H)

####  Data File: ALD_H.xpt

##### First Published: April 2019

##### Last Revised: October 2019

## Component Description

Aldehydes are formed as thermal degradation byproducts released into the
atmosphere from the burning of organic matter such as gasoline, food
flavorants, and tobacco. Aldehydes are potentially carcinogenic and mutagenic;
therefore, exposure to aldehydes has raised concerns about adverse health
effects in humans.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third subsample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

An automated analytical method was developed using solid phase microextraction
(SPME) gas chromatography (GC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
with selected ion mass detection and isotope-dilution techniques. This
analytical method quantifies trace levels of 12 aldehydes from protein adducts
in human serum.

Because aldehydes have the tendency to react with biological molecules to form
various products, including Schiff base protein adducts, free aldehydes
released into the headspace of biological samples from the Schiff base protein
adducts at low pH (~3) are analyzed. The method reproducibly hydrolyzes
aldehyde adducts covalently bound to proteins, using automation to
individually incubate samples prior to analysis with hydrochloric acid (Yeo
2004). Free aldehydes are captured by the SPME fiber; desorbed into the heated
GC injector; and extracted aldehydes are focused at the head of the GC column
using a cryogenically cooled trap (Cryo-trap). Analytes are then separated in
a capillary column and quantified using multiple ion detection (MID) with mass
spectrometry. This method employs isotope dilution to quantify precisely trace
amounts of aldehydes with limits of detection in the low parts per trillion
range. The linear calibration curve spanned over three orders of magnitude.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

This is a new component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.  

## Laboratory Method Files

[Serum Aldehydes Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/ALD_ALDS_H_MET.pdf)
(April 2019)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate refrigerated (2-8Â°C) conditions until they
are shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_13_14/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.  

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data Overview
](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes2013-2014/labdoc_h.htm)for general
information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Serum aldehydes were measured in a one-third subsample of participants 12
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2013-2014 Demographics
File ](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/DEMO_H.htm)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/FASTQX_H.XPT) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the length of fast, and the time
of venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBD4ALLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., LBD4ALLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed LBX (ex., LBX4AL)
provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for serum aldehydes:

LBX9AL |  Nonanaldehyde (ng/mL) |  2.63  
LBX10AL |  Decanaldehyde (ng/mL) |  3.9  
  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
