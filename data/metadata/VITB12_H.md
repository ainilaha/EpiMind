### Vitamin B12 (VITB12_H)

####  Data File: VITB12_H.xpt

#####  First Published: May 2016

#####  Last Revised: August 2017

## Component Description

Vitamin B12 (B12) is an essential cofactor for two enzymes involved in one-
carbon metabolism: methylmalonyl CoA mutase (reduced function of this enzyme
results in increased serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels) and methionine
synthetase (this enzyme catalyzes the remethylmation of homocysteine to
methionine) (IOM 1998). A serum B12 level below the normal expected range may
indicate B12 deficiency. However, a B12 level within the low normal range does
not exclude B12 deficiency; symptomatic patients need to be further evaluated
with MMA, folic acid, and homocysteine (Allen 2008; Cordero, et al. 2008)

A chronic dietary deficiency of either folate or vitamin B12 causes macrocytic
anemia, although strict dietary deficiencies are rare. Most people who develop
a vitamin B12 deficiency have an underlying stomach or intestinal disorder
that limits the absorption of vitamin B12. Subtly reduced cognitive function
resulting from early vitamin B12 deficiency is sometimes the only symptom of
these intestinal disorders. Untreated deficiencies will lead to megaloblastic
anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency results in irreversible central nervous
system degeneration. Hematologic signs, however, are not always present in
vitamin B12 deficiency and hematologic signs and neurologic abnormalities can
be inversely correlated (Baik, et al. 1999).

  

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 19 years and older were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The Elecsys Vitamin B12 assay employs a competitive test principle using
intrinsic factor specific for vitamin B12. The fully automated
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay "ECLIA") is intended for use on Elecsys
and cobas e immunoassay analyzers. The 1st step is to incubate 15 uL of sample
with the vitamin B12 pretreatment 1 and pretreatment 2 to release bound
vitamin B12. The 2nd incubation adds the ruthenium labeled intrinsic factor to
the pretreated sample causing a vitamin B12-binding protein complex to form;
the amount of which is dependent upon the analyte concentration in the sample.
During the 3rd incubation, streptavidin-coated microparticles and vitamin B12
labeled with biotin are added and the still-vacant sites of the ruthenium
labeled intrinsic factor become occupied. This forms a ruthenium labeled
intrinsic factor-vitamin B12 biotin complex. The entire complex becomes bound
to the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavidin. The reaction
mixture is aspirated into the measuring cell where the microparticles are
magnetically captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound substances
are then removed with ProCell. Application of a voltage to the electrode then
induces chemiluminescent emission which is measured by a photomultiplier.
Results are determined via a calibration curve which is instrument
specifically generated by a 2 point calibration and a master curve provided
via the reagent barcode.

(May 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
arediscussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
areconducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.  
  
NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the Westgard rules (Westgard et al,
1981) used when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.  
  
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Sciences'
quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and
precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Two  derived variables were created in this data file. The formula for the
derivation is as follows:

The vitamin B12 data (LBXB12) was adjusted using a Deming regression = LBDB12.  
The vitamin B12 in pg/mL (LBDB12) was converted to pmol/L (LBDB12SI) by
multiplying by 0.738.

## Analytic Notes

**Vitamin B12 for 2013-2014  
**  
Laboratory bench and "blind" quality control pools showed significant shifts
during NHANES 2013-2014. These quality control shifts were associated with
reagent lot-to-lot variations. It was necessary to adjust the vitamin B12 data
using mean quality control pool data using a Deming regression.

Refer to the [2013 - 2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2013-2014 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014
Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2013-2014/fastqx_h.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for this analyte in the data set.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in pg/mL) for vitamin B12:

      **Analyte   ** |  **     Item ID   ** |  **     LLOD**    
---|---|---  
  Vitamin B12  |     LBXB12  |         30  
  
Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
