# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

### Medical Conditions (MCQ_H)

####  Data File: MCQ_H.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2015

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The medical conditions section (variable name prefix MCQ) provides self-
reported personal interview data on a broad range of health conditions for
both children and adults. The NHANES MCQ questionnaire section is generally
modeled on the "Medical Conditions" questionnaire section of the U.S. National
Health Interview Survey.

**Major Topics in the MCQ Section:**

**Health Conditions / Medical History:**

  * Asthma, Childhood and Adult 
  * Anemia 
  * Psoriasis 
  * Heart Diseases 
  * Arthritis 
  * Blood Transfusions 
  * Cancer (Multiple varieties)

  * Gout

## Eligible Sample

The target sample for questions in this section varies by age and gender.
Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency counts were
verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system. The survey
questionnaire is available on the [NHANES
website](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed and edited for completeness, consistency, and illogical
values.

## Analytic Notes

A number of additional questions occur in MCQ that are logically related to
other questionnaire sections or exam segments. Analysts should refer to these
other NHANES sections as part of any data analysis.

Although these data were collected as part of the household questionnaire, if
they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used for
the analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
