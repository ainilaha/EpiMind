### Cytomegalovirus IgG & IgM Antibodies - Serum (CMV_G)

####  Data File: CMV_G.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2013

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

CMV usually does not cause significant disease in healthy individuals, but
pregnant women can transmit CMV to their unborn babies, who are then at risk.
Congenital CMV infection is a significant source of morbidity among children,
causing a wide range of clinical outcomes including hearing loss, mental
retardation, and even death.

During 1988-1994, 36% of 6-11 year old children had evidence of ever being
infected with CMV, while currently, 0.7% of infants are born with congenital
infection each year. However, the seroprevalence among children who may
acquire infection postnatally until the age of 5 has yet to be described at
the national level.  
  
Young children with CMV infection shed the virus in high titers and are a
major source of transmission to other susceptible children and adults, which
is of special concern for pregnant women. For this reason, characterizing
infection among children less than 6 years old is essential to expanding our
understanding of important transmission exposures, mainly breastfeeding and
close contact during childcare, and patterns of primary and recurrent
infections. Such information would inform the development of prevention
strategies to protect vulnerable populations including pregnant women and
their fetuses.

Additionally, young children have been identified as a potential target
population for CMV vaccine development, recently ranked of highest priority by
the Institute of Medicine. Describing the serological profile of children
under the age of 6 would improve our understanding of immunity during early
childhood and facilitate vaccine development.

## Eligible Sample

Survey participants aged 1 to 5 years were eligible to be tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the National Center for
Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Detailed
specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

CMV antigen detects specific antibody in serum. CMV is clinically important in
several patient populations. CMV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Enzyme-linked immuno
sorbent assay (ELISA) use computer programs designed by Biomerieux. All NHANES
specimen numbers were scanned by the barcode reader. The VIDAS instrument read
specimen reactivity and assigned numeric values.

## Data Processing and Editing

The analytical methods are described in the Description of Laboratory
Methodology section above.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing can be found on
the NHANES website.

CMV testing was new to NHANES in 2011.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

The analysis of NHANES 2011-2012 laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. Please refer to the
NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues. Please note
that the available results for Cytomegalovirus (IgG) avidity and
Cytomegalovirus (IgM) do not meet the minimum NHANES sample size requirements
to provide reliable estimates. The [NHANES 2011-2012 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2011)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2011-2012/fastqx_g.htm) includes
auxiliary information such as fasting status, the time of venipuncture, and
the conditions precluding venipuncture. The demographics and fasting
questionnaire files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
