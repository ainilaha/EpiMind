### Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) - Urine (L31PAH_C)

####  Data File: L31PAH_C.xpt

#####  First Published: January 2008

#####  Last Revised: July 2009

## Component Description

**Urinary Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**

PAHs constitute a group of chemicals which are formed during the incomplete
combustion of coal, oil and gas, garbage, and other organic substances. These
compounds require metabolic activation prior to their interactions with
cellular macromolecules. PAHs are ubiquitous; thus, exposure to them is
widespread. In general, people are exposed to mixtures of PAHs, the sources of
which include vehicle exhausts, asphalt roads, coal, coal tar, wild fires,
agricultural burning, charbroiled foods, and hazardous waste sites. PAHs enter
the body quickly and easily by all routes of exposure and are readily and
predominantly metabolized to hydroxylated metabolites as well as glucuronide
metabolites. These metabolites are excellent indicators of exposure to the
parent PAHs. Although background level ranges of PAHs in air and water are
known, the equivalent metabolite background levels in humans are not known.
Because of increased epidemiologic data relating PAH exposure to cancer
incidence, biomonitoring PAH metabolites in humans is very important.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The specific analytes measured in this method are monohydroxy-PAH (OH-PAH).
The procedure involves enzymatic hydrolysis of urine, extraction,
derivatization and analysis using capillary gas chromatog-raphy combined with
high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS). This method uses isotope dilution
with carbon-13 labeled internal standards. Ions from each analyte and each
carbon-13 labeled internal standard are monitored, and the abundances of each
ion are measured. The ratios of these ions are used as criteria for evaluating
the data. By evaluating these analytes in urine, a measurement of the body
burden from PAH exposure is obtained.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the laboratories. NCEH developed and distributed a quality control protocol
for all the laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running
NHANES specimens. Summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS. NCHS reviewed the data for
trends or shifts. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard 1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary PAHs were measured in a one third subsample of persons 6
years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
URD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable named URX___ provides the analytic result for
that analyte. In cases, where the result was below the limit of detection, the
value for that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of
two.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
