####  Data File: SSFA_C.xpt

##### First Published: August 2011

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (<5% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries

## Component Description

Measurement of concentrations (µmol/L) of 24 fatty acids in a 1,845 sample
subset of NHANES 2003-2004 plasma samples.

## Eligible Sample

Fasting (≥ 8 hours) participants ≥ 20 years of age from NHANES 2003-2004.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

** _Measurement of Plasma Fatty Acids_**

Modification of the method of Lagerstedt _et al._ was used to measure total
fatty acid concentrations in plasma. In brief, a 100µL plasma sample was
spiked with 100µL of a mixture of 11 internal standards (fatty acids labeled
with stable isotopes) to account for recovery. Esterified fatty acids were
hydrolyzed from lipids such as triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesteryl
esters using sequential treatment with acid then base. Following base
hydrolysis, the samples were re-acidified and total fatty acids were hexane-
extracted from the matrix along with internal standards. Extracts were
derivatized with pentafluorobenzyl bromide in the presence of triethylamine to
form pentafluorobenzyl (PFB) esters and were reconstituted in hexane.

PFB-fatty acid derivatives were injected onto a capillary gas chromatographic
column to resolve individual _cis_ -fatty acids of interest from other matrix
constituents. Analytes were detected using electron capture negative-ion mass
spectrometry. Twenty-four _cis_ -fatty acids (6 saturated- (SFA), 7
monounsaturated- (MUFA), and 11 polyunsaturated- (PUFA)) were quantified using
selected ion monitoring; for each fatty acid, recovery was estimated and
results were adjusted using the most appropriate isotopically-labeled internal
standard.

Separations were carried-out on a 0.25mm × 60m (0.25µm film thickness)
cyanopropyl-methylpolysiloxane phase (50:50) capillary column at a constant
flow rate of 2 mL/min helium carrier gas. Injection volume per sample was 1µL;
split ratios varied from 50:1 to 150:1. Injector temperature was maintained at
240°C. The column heating oven started at 170°C then ramped 30°C/min to 230°C
and held for 10 min. The temperature then ramped 2°C/min to 250ºC and held for
4.5 minutes. All ramping of temperatures was linear. The total run time was
26.5 minutes per sample.

Methane (reagent gas) flow rate was set at 40% of the total flow (actual flow:
2mL/min). The mass spectrometer source was set at 170°C and the quadrupole was
set at 150°C.

The acquisition method operated in negative ion mode. A selected ion
monitoring (SIM) mass was monitored for each analyte and isotopically labeled
standard. The 35 SIM masses were divided into SIM segments (5-7 SIM masses per
segment) based on retention time. In some segments enhanced detector
sensitivity was used to quantitate low abundance fatty acids.

Fragmentation of PFB-fatty acid esters using negative chemical ionization
(NCI) resulted in a reproducible loss of the PFB moiety giving a stable
carboxylate anion (mass minus 1 amu). Filament voltage, inlet temperature,
percent reagent gas flow, and source temperature were optimized to yield
optimum intensity of selected compounds.

Internal standards were labeled with deuterium or carbon-13.

In the following table, SIM masses are grouped by the internal standard that
was used to normalize recovery for the group of fatty acids. Lipid Name
indicates the carbon number in the long chain: number of double bonds in the
carbon chain and the n- position of the bond closest to the terminal carbon
(farthest from the carbonyl carbon).

Quantitation was accomplished by comparing the peak area of the analyte in the
unknown with peak areas of known amounts of fatty acid based on calibration
curves. Calibration curves were prepared for each assay using four levels (Cal
10 - Cal 40) per fatty acid. Calculations were corrected based on the peak
area of the internal standard in the unknown compared with the peak area of
the internal standard in the calibrator solution. Best fits of concentration
versus response were obtained when 1/x2 was used for all fatty acids except
palmitic which used a quadratic fit to calibrate the assay. Peak area ratios
(quantitation m/z: internal standard m/z) were linearly related to
concentration. Calibration curves were required to have r2 of at least 0.98
and calibrators were required to be within 15% of their nominal values. The
overall average r2 (SD) of calibration curves, including all analytes in all
assays, was 0.999 (0.002).

Blanks were analyzed concurrently with the samples and were used to determine
if any analyte contamination had occurred. Blanks were required to be less
than 20% of the lowest calibrator (Cal 10).

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all the laboratory testing was complete. The data
were not edited for extreme values.

Data Access: All final data are publicly available.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The laboratory and method were certified according to the Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (1988) guidelines

Units of plasma were obtained from Solomon Park Research Laboratories
(Kirkland, WA) and were screened using the methodology described above to
obtain the concentrations of each of 24 fatty acids per unit. All quality
control pools were prepared by blending units to achieve as best as possible,
representative low, medium and high concentrations. Aliquots were dispensed
into 2mL cryovials and stored at -70°C.

Before each analytical run, calibration standards, bench QC materials and
plasma samples were thawed from -70°C to room temperature. Calibrators and QC
materials were prepared and analyzed in parallel with the unknown samples.

Typical assays consisted of 4 calibration samples, 1 blank, 3 bench quality
control samples, 34 subject person's plasma followed by 3 quality control
samples. Typically, one in every 20 subject person's plasma in the assay was
actually a blind QC pool which was labeled to resemble a subject person
specimen. Two blind QC pools were used throughout the period of analysis of
the survey specimens. Their results were required to be within 3 standard
deviations of the characterization means for each analyte. Blind QC pools were
characterized in singlicate in >40 assays. Mean CV (SD) for all analytes in
both blind QC pools was 9% (10%); excluding DE1_N, mean CV (SD) was 7% (3%).

Bench QC pools (open label) were named as follows:  
High: HP_066209_QC05  
Low: LP_06553_QC05  
Medium: MP_066208_QC05  
Bench QC pools were characterized to determine the quality control limits by
analyzing duplicate samples in 22 assays from 1/13/2010 to 3/24/2010. After
establishment of the control limits of the pools, QC samples contained within
each analytical run were evaluated for validity by use of a multi-rule quality
control. Mean CV (SD) for all analytes in the three bench QC pools was 8%
(10%); excluding DE1_N, mean CV (SD) was 6% (2%).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of fatty acids were measured in a one half fasting subsample of
persons 20 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.
