## Eligible Sample

Please review the questionnaire and codebook carefully. Frequency counts were
verified during the preparation of the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

**Interview Setting:**

Trained household interviewers collected all of the Sample Person interviews.
In most cases, the interview setting was the Sample Person's home. The
information was recorded using a format computer-assisted personal interview
(CAPI) system. All household interviewers were required to complete a
comprehensive two-week training program. Many of the interviewers had prior
interviewing experience. A large percentage of the household interviewers were
bilingual in English and Spanish.

NHANES interviewer training included role-playing exercises and practice
interviews, all of which were monitored by NCHS and contractor staff.
Additionally, all of the NHANES questionnaires were translated into Spanish
and were accessible in CAPI format. Detailed information about the interviewer
training requirements is found in the NHANES Household Interviewer Training
Manual.

**Examination Protocol:**

Not applicable. The VIQ section was part of the Household Interview component
of the survey; this component is completed prior to the mobile examination
center (MEC) component.

**Data Collection:**

All of the responses to the questionnaire items were recorded using the NHANES
CAPI interview system. Some of the questions in the VIQ section required the
use of printed hand cards. When necessary, the household interviewers read the
hand card selections to the respondent.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Several types of quality control were implemented to ensure that high quality
data were collected during the survey.

Interviewer monitoring was a major responsibility for NCHS and contractor
staff. Interviewers were frequently accompanied on interviews and observed to
verify that the interview protocol was administered correctly. Interviewers
were retrained on survey procedures if necessary.

Extensive pretesting was completed prior to implementing the questionnaires in
the field. A full "dress rehearsal" pilot test was conducted with the field
and examination staff to test all of the survey participant contact,
interview, and examination procedures.

The interviewers are encouraged to provide comments and other suggestions,
based on their field experiences. NCHS has used field staff and interviewer
feedback to improve the questionnaires and survey materials. Annual staff
debriefing and training sessions are conducted jointly by NCHS and contractor
staff. Interviewers are trained on new survey content and protocol changes
prior to implementation in the field.

With respect to data collection quality control, the CAPI systems have built-
in edit and range checks for most questions that have open-ended response
options. When unusual or unrealistic responses were recorded, the interviewer
is alerted immediately and instructed to verify or edit the initial response.

## Data Processing and Editing

Frequency counts were checked, "skip" patterns were verified, and the
reasonableness of responses to the questions was reviewed.

There were no edits made to the responses to the questions.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 1999-2000 vision data must be conducted with the key
survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 1999-2000 Household
Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and
other related information collected during household interviews. They also
contain all survey design variables and sample weights for these age groups.
Other household questionnaire and vision examination files may be linked to
the vision questionnaire data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

Please refer to the NCHS analytic guidelines to determine the appropriate
analytic plan for this dataset.
