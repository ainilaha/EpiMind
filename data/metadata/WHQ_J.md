### Weight History (WHQ_J)

####  Data File: WHQ_J.xpt

##### First Published: June 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Weight History section of the Sample Person Questionnaire (variable name
prefix WHQ) provides personal interview data on several topics related to body
weight, including self-perception of weight, self-reported weight over the
participant's lifetime, attempted weight loss during the past 12 months, and
methods used to try to lose weight and to keep from gaining weight.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 16 years and older were eligible. However, age to
participate for some questions in this section varies. Please review the
codebook carefully. Frequency counts were verified during the preparation of
the file.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

Trained interviewers asked these questions, in the home, using the Computer-
Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system.

For details on the administration of the WHQ_J, please refer to the Weight
History Sample Person Questionnaire on the [NHANES
website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=2017).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to some variables to ensure the completeness, consistency, and
analytic usefulness of the data. Edits were also made, when necessary, to
address data disclosure concerns. When a variable was modified globally, as
part of the editing process, the third letter in the variable name was changed
from a Q (i.e., WHQ) to a D (i.e., WHD). For example, height data were
collected as feet and inches, but standardized to inches using the conversion
factors 0.3937 inches per centimeter and 12 inches per foot. Current and past
self-reported weights were standardized to weight in pounds using the
conversion factor 2.2046 pounds per kilogram.

Reported heights and weights, considered being physiologically implausible or
the result of interviewer data entry error, were coded as "missing."

If maximum weight (WHQ150) extended over more than one year, the interviewer
recorded the most recent age at which the survey participant reported that
weight.

All responses to WHQ150 (age when weighed the most) of 80 years and older were
coded as "80" to be consistent with the way age of the survey participant was
coded in the demographic file.

## Analytic Notes

Although data in this file were collected as part of the household interview,
if they are merged with the MEC exam data, exam sample weights should be used
for analyses.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
