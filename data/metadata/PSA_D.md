### Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) (PSA_D)

####  Data File: PSA_D.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2007

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin malignancy among men with
approximately 180,000 new cases diagnosed and 37,000 deaths in 1999. The total
and free PSA tests have been recognized as tumor markers for the screening,
diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.

Total and free prostate specific antigens (PSA) were measured among men age 40
years and older. PSA exclusion questions (KIQ115, KIQ185, KIQ191, KIQ195,
KIQ201, KIQ241, KIQ282, KIQ301, and  
KIQ311) were asked during the physician's examination. PSA immunoassays were
performed on blood specimens using the Hybritech tests (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA).

## Eligible Sample

Male participants aged 40 years and older were tested for PSA. Those who
reported having any of the following conditions were not eligible for PSA
testing:

  * Current infection or inflammation of the prostate gland (KIQ115) 
  * Rectal exam in the past week (KIQ185) 
  * Prostate biopsy in the past month (KIQ191) 
  * Cystoscopy in the past month (KIQ195) 
  * History of prostate cancer (KIQ201)

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Free prostate specific antigen**

The Access Hybritech free PSA assay is a two-site immunoenzymatic "sandwich"
assay. A sample was added to a reaction vessel with mouse monoclonal anti-free
PSA alkaline phosphatase conjugate, and paramagnetic particles coated with a
second mouse monoclonal anti- free PSA antibody. The free PSA in the sample
bound to the immobilized monoclonal anti-free PSA on the solid phase while, at
the same time, the monoclonal anti-PSA conjugate reacted with a different
antigenic site on the sample free PSA. Separation in a magnetic field and
washing removes material not bound to the solid phase. A chemiluminescent
substrate, Lumi-Phostm 530 was added to the reaction vessel and light
generated by the reaction was measured with a luminometer. The light
production was proportional to the concentration of free PSA in the sample.
The amount of analyte in the sample was determined by means of a stored,
multi-point calibration curve.

**Total prostate specific antigen**

Total PSA values were obtained using the Hybritech PSA method on the Beckman
Access. A second sample was added to a reaction vessel with mouse monoclonal
anti-PSA alkaline phosphatase conjugate and paramagnetic particles coated with
a second mouse monoclonal anti- PSA antibody. The PSA in the sample bound to
the immobilized monoclonal anti-PSA on the solid phase while, at the same
time, the monoclonal anti-PSA conjugate reacted with a different antigenic
site on the sample PSA. The light production was proportional to the
concentration of PSA in the sample.

**Prostate specific antigen ratio**

This ratio was calculated by dividing the free PSA by the total PSA:

LBDP3 = round ((LBXP2/LBXP1)*100) (whole number)

There were no changes to the equipment, lab method, or lab site from the
previous two years. A detailed description of the laboratory method used can
be found at NHANES web page.

## Data Processing and Editing

Blood specimens are processed, stored and shipped to University of Washington,
Seattle, Washington. Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed data processing and editing
protocols. The analytical methods are described in the Analytic methodology
section.

Because of the confidentiality of the data any male participant 86 years and
older was recoded to "greater than 85". See the NHANES web page link to
determine "below detectable limit fill values" for this data.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found at NHANES web page.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2005-2006 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2005-2006
Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and
other related information collected during household interview and MEC
examination. They also contain sample weights for these agegroups. The
phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such as the conditions
precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaireand phlebotomy files may
be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

Data on health conditions that would make a sample person ineligible for PSA
testing are missing for somepeople with non-missing PSA lab data. This
happened mainly because some sample persons did not attend the physician's
examination component of the MEC examination where such data were collected.
It is advisable to exclude these observations for PSA analyses.
