### Dietary Interview - Individual Foods, Second Day (DR2IFF_D)

####  Data File: DR2IFF_D.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2008

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary
intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used
to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages consumed during the
24-hour period prior to the interview (midnight to midnight), and to estimate
intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those foods and
beverages. Beginning in 2005-2006, water drunk throughout the day is collected
as part of the 24-hour dietary recall (see more details in the "What's New
with the 2005-2006 WWEIA Release" section). Following the dietary recall,
participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the person's intake on
the previous day was usual or unusual, and whether the respondent is on any
type of special diet. Survey participants 1 year or older were asked questions
on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days.

The dietary interview component, called What We Eat in America (WWEIA), is
conducted as a partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Under this
partnership, DHHS' National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) is responsible
for the sample design and data collection and USDA's Food Surveys Research
Group (FSRG) is responsible for the dietary data collection methodology,
maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data, and data
review and processing.

All NHANES examinees are eligible for two 24-hour dietary recall interviews.
The first dietary recall interview is collected in-person in the Mobile
Examination Center (MEC) and the second interview is collected by telephone 3
to 10 days later.

As in previous years, two types of dietary intake data are available for the
2005-2006 survey cycle - Individual Foods files and Total Nutrient Intakes
files. Each of these dietary intake data files is accompanied by a PDF file
containing its documentation, codebook, and frequencies. The structure of the
PDF file for the 2005-2006 dietary intake data files has been modified
slightly from earlier survey years so that the documentation section of the
file for each of the two types of dietary intake data files is identical.

**What 's New with the 2005-2006 WWEIA Release:** One of the major changes to
this release is that beginning with the 2005-2006 WWEIA, the consumption of
all types of water (including tap and bottled water, plain and carbonated,
sweetened and unsweetened water) was collected during the 24-hour recall. As a
result, each report of water intake throughout the day was collected and coded
as a separate food item. These water intake items now appear in the Individual
Foods file with food codes designating the type of water. As with other foods,
a variable is present to indicate if the water was consumed at home or away.
For bottled waters, a variable is present indicating where the water was
obtained. For tap water, the variables DR1TWS and DR2TWS in the Total Nutrient
Intake files indicate the main source of tap water drunk by the participant.
In 2003-2004, only sweetened bottled waters were collected during the 24-hour
recall and included in the Individual Foods file. Information on daily intake
of non-sweetened waters (total plain water, total tap water and the source of
tap water, total bottled water, and plain carbonated water) were collected
after the 24-hour dietary recall and included in the Total Nutrient Intake
file for 2003-2004. In 2005-2006, summary water variables that are compatible
with previous data cycles are included in the Total Nutrient Intake files with
the exception of plain carbonated water. These water totals (DR1_320Z,
DR2_320Z, DR1_330Z, DR2_330Z, DR1BWATZ and DR2BWATZ) represent total water
consumed as a beverage by itself. Therefore, they do not include the moisture
content of foods and beverages (such as watermelon, coffee, lettuce) that are
available for each food reported in the Individual Foods files.  
  
The table in Appendix 1 summarizes additional changes among the 3 latest
cycles of data collection.  
  
**Dietary Interview Data Files:** Four data files were produced from the
information collected in the dietary interview: two Individual Foods files and
two Total Nutrient Intake files. Each file includes one day of intake data.
The number "1" or "2" in the file name identifies the day (and mode) of the
interview: 1 = first day (in-person), 2 = second day (phone). File names are
the following:

File Names for Dietary Interview Data  File | Day 1 | Day 2  
---|---|---  
Individual Foods File | DRIFF_D | DR2IFF_D  
TotalNutrient Intakes File | DR1TOT_D | DR2TOT_D  
  
The nutrient amounts in these files reflect only nutrients obtained from
foods, beverages, and water including tap and bottled water. They do not
include nutrients obtained from dietary supplements, antacids, or medications.

**Individual Foods Files (DR1IFF_D and DR2IFF_D):** Detailed information about
the types and amounts of individual foods reported by each participant, as
well as amounts of nutrients from each food are included in the Individual
Foods files. The names for both Day 1 and Day 2 variables are listed in
Appendix 2.

Two supporting files are also included with the Individual Foods files: the
Food Code Description file (DRXFCD_D) and the Modification Code Description
file (DRXMCD_D). The DRXFCD_D file includes abbreviated descriptions (up to 60
characters) and complete descriptions (up to 200 characters) associated with
each USDA food code identified in the Individual Foods files. The DRXMCD_D
file includes descriptions (up to 200 characters) associated with each
modification code identified in the Individual Foods files. Modification codes
represent adjustments to predefined recipe ingredients that reflect more
closely the food as described by the respondent. Appendix 3 provides SAS code
examples that may be used to link the food code or the modification code
description to the Individual Foods file.

The Individual Foods files include, for each interview day, one record for
each food consumed by a survey participant. Each food record is sequentially
numbered and contains the information listed below:

  * Number of days of complete intake obtained from participant 
  * Day of the week of the intake 
  * Time of eating occasion when the food was eaten 
  * Eating occasion name 
  * Food, water, or beverage identified by a USDA food code 
  * Amount of food, water, and beverages consumed, in grams 
  * Whether the food was eaten in combination with other foods, such as in a sandwich 
  * Whether the food was eaten at home or not 
  * Where the food was obtained 
  * Amounts of energy and 63 nutrients/food components (listed in Appendix 4) from each food, as calculated using USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, 3.0 (FNDDS 3.0) 
  * Whether nutrients were calculated directly from the food as identified in FNDDS 3.0 or the FNDDS item was modified by adjusting recipe ingredients 

**Total Nutrient Intakes Files (DR1TOT_D and DR2TOT_D):** For each
participant, daily total energy and nutrient intakes from foods and beverages
and whether the amount of food consumed was usual, much more than usual, or
much less than usual are included in the Total Nutrient Intakes files. The Day
1 file also includes information on salt use in cooking and at the table;
whether the participant is currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for
other health-related reason and, if so, the type of diet; and for participants
1 year or older, information on frequency of fish and shellfish consumption.
The names for both Day 1 and Day 2 variables are listed in Appendix 5.

The Total Nutrient Intakes files provide a summary record of total nutrient
intakes for each individual. Each total intake record contains the following
information:

  * Number of days of complete intake obtained from participant 
  * Day of the week of the intake 
  * Daily aggregates of food energy and 63 nutrients/food components (listed in Appendix 4) from all foods, as calculated using USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 3.0 (FNDDS 3.0) 
  * The daily aggregates of water (moisture), DR1TMOIS and DR2TMOIS, consist of all moisture present in foods and beverages, including tap and bottled waters consumed as beverages 
  * Total amount of water consumed (plain water, tap water and the source of tap water, and bottled water 
  * Total number of foods reported for that participant for that day's intake 
  * Whether the amount of food consumed was usual, much more than usual, or much less than usual 
  * Type of salt used and how often added at the table and in food preparation (Day 1 file only) 
  * Whether the participant is currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and, if so, the type of diet (Day 1 file only) 
  * Frequency of fish and shellfish consumption in the past 30 days (examinees one year or older, Day 1 file only) 

## Eligible Sample

All NHANES examinees are eligible for the dietary interview component.
However, only examinees one year or older are eligible for the frequency of
fish and shellfish consumption questions following the 24-hour recall.

## Protocol and Procedure

The examination protocol and data collection methods are fully documented in
the NHANES dietary interviewers procedures manuals (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey MEC
In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedure Manual, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Phone Follow-
Up Dietary Interviewer Procedure Manual).

Interviews were conducted for survey participants less than six years of age
with a proxy who was generally the person most knowledgeable about the survey
participant's intake. With children ages 6 to 11, the interviews were
conducted with the child and the assistance of an adult familiar with the
child's intake. Dietary interviews were conducted in English and Spanish.
Translators were used to conduct interviews in other languages.

The in-person interview was conducted in a private room in the NHANES mobile
examination center (MEC). A set of measuring guides (various glasses, bowls,
mugs, drink boxes and bottles, household spoons, measuring cups and spoons, a
ruler, thickness sticks, bean bags, and circles) was available in the MEC
dietary interview room for the participant to use for reporting amounts of
foods (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey Measuring Guides for the Dietary Recall
Interview). Upon completion of the in-person interview, participants were
given measuring cups, spoons, a ruler, and a food model booklet, which
contained two-dimensional drawings of the various measuring guides available
in the MEC, to use for reporting food amounts during the telephone interview.
Telephone dietary interviews were collected 3 to 10 days following the MEC
dietary interview but not on the same day of the week as the MEC interview.
Any participant who did not have a telephone was given a toll-free number to
call so that the recall could be conducted.

What We Eat in America data were collected using USDA's dietary data
collection instrument, the Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) (Agricultural
Research Service, USDA Automated Multiple-Pass Method for Dietary Recalls).
The AMPM was designed to provide an efficient and accurate means of collecting
intakes for large-scale national surveys. The AMPM is a fully computerized
recall method that uses a 5-step interview outlined below:

  1. **Quick List** \- Participant recalls all foods and beverages consumed the day before the interview (midnight to midnight). 
  2. **Forgotten Foods** \- Participant is asked about consumption of foods commonly forgotten during the Quick List step. 
  3. **Time and Occasion** \- Time and eating occasion are collected for each food. 
  4. **Detail Cycle** \- For each food, a detailed description, amount eaten, and additions to the food are collected. Eating occasions and times between eating occasions are reviewed to elicit forgotten foods. 
  5. **Final Probe** \- Additional foods not remembered earlier are collected. 

The AMPM includes an extensive compilation of standardized food-specific
questions and possible response options. Routing of questions is based on
previous responses. The AMPM is updated yearly to reflect the changing food
supply and to address research needs from the data user community. Additional
information about the AMPM is provided in Raper et al. (Raper, 2004).

FSRG conducted the AMPM Validation Study to evaluate the accuracy of this
dietary intake method. Completed in 2004, this extensive research project
included 524 healthy, weight-stable volunteers, aged 30-69 years. The accuracy
of the AMPM was evaluated by comparing reported energy intake (EI) to total
energy expenditure (TEE) using the doubly labeled water technique (Moshfegh).
Among the findings were that EI compared to TEE was under-reported by 11%
overall and by less than 3% for normal weight subjects with body mass index
(BMI) <25\.

Other studies have also reported on the validity of the AMPM to measure group
energy intake (EI). Blanton reported that EI was not significantly different
from TEE for a sample of 20 adult females (Blanton, 2006). Rumpler and
colleagues found that mean EIs were accurately reported for a sample of 12
adult males (Rumpler, 2008).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

All dietary interviewers were required to complete an intensive one-week
training course and to conduct supervised practice interviews before working
independently in the field. Retraining sessions were conducted annually to
reinforce the proper protocols and technique.  
  
Interviewers were monitored throughout the data collection period. Monitoring
consisted of the following:

  * Data transmittal sheets were reviewed to verify receipt of data files. 
  * Reviews of audio-taped interviews or in-person observations were conducted for approximately 5% of each interviewer's work. 
  * Interviews were checked for completeness of the recalls, missing information, inconsistent reports, and unclear notes. Written notification and feedback were provided to the interviewers. 



## Data Processing and Editing

Interview data files were sent electronically from the field and were imported
into Survey Net, a computer-assisted food coding and data management system
developed by USDA (Raper, 2004).

USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies, 3.0 (FNDDS 3.0), was
used for processing the 2005-2006 intakes. The FNDDS includes comprehensive
information that can be used to code individual foods and portion sizes
reported by participants and also includes nutrient values for calculating
nutrient intakes. The underlying nutrient values for FNDDS 3.0 were based on
values in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, release
20, produced by USDA's Nutrient Data Lab (Agricultural Research Service, USDA
National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 20). FNDDS values
are updated for every 2-year WWEIA, NHANES release cycle. FNDDS 3.0
corresponds with WWEIA 2005-2006. Additional information about the FNDDS and
related tools is available on the Food Surveys Research Group website (Raper,
2004, Agricultural Research Service, USDA Food and Nutrient Database for
Dietary Studies 3.0, Anand, 2006, Bodner-Montville, 2006, Ahuja, 2008).

Coders were required to pass a certification test after the initial training.
They were routinely monitored to ensure the quality and completeness of their
work. Approximately 10 percent of the coder's work was randomly selected to be
independently coded by another coder. Results from the two codings were
compared and adjudicated, if necessary.

After intake data were coded, various types of reviews were conducted to
ensure the quality of the data. An overview of quality assurance procedures
conducted during the data processing stage is available in Anand, et al.
(Anand, 2006). Examples of reviews include the following:

  * Overall acceptability of each recall. This review determined if the recall met the two minimum criteria listed below. A recall was considered unacceptable if it failed to meet either of these criteria: 
    1. The first 4 steps of the 5-step AMPM are completed. Failure to meet this criterion occurs infrequently and is usually due to the participant stopping the interview before completion of the fourth step. This step collects the details (description and amount consumed) for each reported food. 
    2. Foods consumed for each reported meal must be identified. 
  * Interviewers' and coders' questions and comments are reviewed to ensure that they have been accounted for in coding. 
  * Decisions are made about how to code new or unusual foods or food quantities reported by participants.   
Foods or portions that could not be matched to items in the database are
resolved by FSRG scientists. New food items and new portion sizes are added as
needed to the FNDDS. Information about new foods and package sizes are
collected using internet resources, direct contact with manufacturers, or food
labels. Unusual food mixtures are coded using multiple food codes to represent
the mixture, linking those foods with a combination food number, and
specifying the type of food mixture (such as a salad or soup).

  * Specific data integrity checks for reasonableness, consistency, and logic.   
Many quality control features are built into the AMPM software, including
automated routing based on the participant's previous answers and extensive
checks which prevent illogical responses. Nevertheless, over 50 unique checks
are conducted across all dietary data. Examples are meals reported at unusual
times (e.g., school lunch at 12:30 a.m.), foods not usually consumed by
certain age groups (e.g., baby foods consumed by respondents over 2 years of
age), and extremely large quantities of foods.

  * Intakes with extreme levels for individual nutrients. Nutrient intakes are reviewed separately for various age and sex groups. Unusual values are examined and corrected when necessary. 

During data processing, the following edits were made to ensure the logical
consistency and analytic usefulness of the data:

  * Adjusted sodium values for certain foods.   

Sodium values for home-prepared foods are based on the sodium values of recipe
ingredients in the FNDDS. In some cases, the amount of salt in recipes was
reduced or eliminated if the participant answered dietary interview questions
about salt use in cooking or preparing foods with the response "occasionally",
"rarely" or "never," respectively.

  * Modified nutrient values for some food mixtures.   

During the food coding process, predefined recipes for some food mixtures are
modified to match more closely the food as described by the respondent.
Nutrients are modified by substituting ingredients in a predefined recipe for
the mixture. An example of a modified recipe is an egg fried in butter instead
of margarine. Each modification is assigned a unique 6-digit identification
number. Recipe modification numbers appear in the variable DR1MC in the
DR1IFF_D file and in the variable DR2MC in the DR2IFF_D file. Descriptions for
each modification are provided in a separate file called DRXMCD.

## Analytic Notes

Each Individual Foods file (Day 1 and Day 2) is comprised of food records. For
most survey participants, there are multiple records in each file. For each
Total Nutrient Intakes file (Day 1 and Day 2) there is one record for each
participant. These files can be linked with other NHANES files by the
respondent sequence number (SEQN).

**Variable names:** For data collected on both Day 1 and Day 2, variable names
are differentiated by having the number "1" or "2" in the third position of
the variable name to identify the collection day. For example, the USDA food
code variable (in the Individual Foods File), which identifies the food
reported by the participant, is named DR1IFDCD in the Day 1 file and DR2IFDCD
in the Day 2 file. Appendices 2 and 5 list the Day 1 and Day 2 variable names
for the Individual Foods file and the Total Nutrient Intakes file,
respectively.

Names for the following variables are the same for both days in the Individual
Foods file and the Total Nutrient Intakes file:

**Variables with the Same Name for Both Days in the Dietary Interview Files** Day 1 and Day 2 Variable Name | Label  
---|---  
SEQN | Respondent sequence number  
WTDRD1 | Dietary day one sample weight  
WTDR2D | Dietary two-day sample weight  
DRABF | Breast-fed infant (either day)  
DRDINT | Number of days of intake  
  
**Number of days of intake:** Because two days of data are included in the
2005-2006 release, a variable has been included to indicate the number of days
of intake available for each participant. The variable name is DRDINT.

**Dietary recall status code:** A status code (DR1DRSTZ or DR2DRSTZ) is used
in both the Individual Foods and Total Nutrient Intake files to indicate the
quality and completeness of a survey participant's response to the dietary
recall section. The codes are the following:

1 = Reliable and met the minimum criteria  
For individuals with a code 1, all relevant variables associated with the
24-hour dietary recall contain a value.

2 = Not reliable or did not meet the minimum criteria  
Individuals with a code 2 have incomplete records. No data on total nutrient
intakes and the total number of foods reported are provided for these cases.
These individuals have no records in the Individual Foods files.

3 [Code 3 is not included in the current datasets. It was only used for data
from the 1999-2000 survey cycle.]

4 = Reported consuming breast milk  
For infants and children who consumed human milk, there is a record in the
Individual Foods files for each report of human milk. However, because amounts
of human milk intake are not quantified, these records contain missing values
for the amount consumed and for the amounts of energy and nutrients from human
milk. Also, records of human milk have a missing value for the food source
variable (DR1FS, DR2FS) and the eaten at home variable (DR1_040Z, DR2_040Z) in
the Individual Foods files. Records for any other foods and beverages consumed
by breast-fed infants and children are included in the Individual Foods files
along with their amounts and nutrient information. Because of the missing
nutrient information for human milk, no total nutrient intakes (contained in
the Total Nutrient Intakes files) were computed for participants with a code
4.

A variable that identifies breast-fed children, DRABF, is included. This
variable has a code of 1 if a child consumed breast milk in either intake day.

5 = Not done  
This code is assigned when the dietary recall section of the interview did not
take place due to various reasons (such as arrived late/left early, refusal,
illness, emergency, or equipment failure). These individuals have no records
in the Individual Foods files. These individuals have a record in the Total
Nutrients file with values only for the following variables: the respondent
sequence number (SEQN), the dietary recall status code (DR1DRSTZ or DR2DRSTZ)
and for participants one year or older, the fish and shellfish questions in
the DR1TOT_D file (DRD340, DRD350A-K, DRD350AQ-JQ, DRD360, DRD370A-V, and
DRD370AQ-UQ)

Although there are four possible values, only codes 1 and 4 appear in the
Individual Foods file. In addition to the status code described above, the
variable DR1_300 and DR2_300 in the Total Nutrients file, denotes the
participant's assessment of whether the amount of food he/she consumed on the
recall day was usual, much more than usual, or much less than usual.

**Participants who reported consuming only water:** In 2001-2002 and
2003-2004, individuals who reported consuming only water had no records in the
Individual Foods file for that specific day. Their dietary recall status
variable for the day was coded as "1" (complete and reliable) in the Total
Nutrients file, and the total number of foods and all total nutrient intake
variables were coded as "0". Values were present for other variables collected
during the dietary recall.

In 2005-2006, information on all waters were collected during the 24-hour
recall and reported in the Individual Foods file, including tap water and
bottled water. Therefore, records are now included in the Individual Foods
file for participants who consumed only water. There are 3 such individuals in
the 2005-2006 datasets. Their dietary recall status variable for the day is
coded as "1" (complete and reliable) in the Total Nutrients file and the total
number of foods is coded based on how many times water was reported. There are
5 nutrients for the tap water and plain bottled water codes that have values
greater than zero - calcium, magnesium, sodium, zinc, and copper. Individuals
with just water intake and no food intake will have zero energy intake for the
day. Depending on the type of analysis, these individuals may need to be
excluded from the analysis.

**Food source:** The source of each food (where it was obtained, e.g., from a
store, fast food restaurant, cafeteria) is included with the 2005-2006 release
as it was for 2003-2004. The variable names are DR1FS and DR2FS and are
located in the Individual Foods file. Food source information was also
collected in 2002, but was not publicly released because of confidentiality
issues concerning single-year data. For 2005-2006, a food source for
fundraiser sales has been added to reflect a frequently reported response in
the "other, specify" field; its food source code number is 26. The code
descriptions for this variable are:

Eating occasion is designated by the respondent. During the interview, a list
of eating occasion names is available to the respondent for reference.
However, eating occasion names are not defined for the respondent and the
interpretation may differ from one person to another.

**Combination foods:** Foods that are eaten in combination with other foods,
such as cereal with milk, are identified by a combination food type (DR1CCMTX)
and a combination food number (DR1CCMNM). They are located in the Individual
Foods file. About half of the foods reported in 2005-2006 were consumed in
combination with other foods. The code descriptions for this variable are the
following:

**Code Description for Type of Combination Food Variable** Code | Description  
---|---  
0 | Non-combination food   
1 | Beverage w/ additions   
2 | Cereal w/ additions   
3 | Bread/baked prod w/ additions  
4 | Salad   
5 | Sandwiches   
6 | Soup   
7 | Frozen meals   
8 | Ice cream/frozen yogurt w/ additions  
9 | Dried beans and vegetable w/ additions  
10 | Fruit w/ additions  
11 | Tortilla products  
12 | Meat, poultry, fish  
13 | Lunchables®  
14 | Chips w/ additions   
90 | Other mixtures  
  
**Special diet:** Information on whether the participant is currently on any
kind of diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and, if so, the
type of diet, is included. The variable DRQSDIET identifies whether a
participant is on a special diet. The variables DRQSDT1 through DRQSDT8 and
DRQSDT91 identify the type of diet(s) that the participant is following. These
variables can be found in the Total Nutrient Intakes file.

Note: A participant could report more than one type of diet, and all the
responses were recorded. The variable DRQSDT1 denotes the type of diet the
participant followed specifically for weight loss purposes, including a
variety of low calorie diets, low carbohydrate diets, and/or high protein
diets. If the participant reported being on a high protein diet for the
purpose of gaining weight or muscle building instead of weight loss, the
response was coded in variable DRQSDT8 (Weight gain/Muscle building diet).

**Sample weights for dietary intake data:** The NHANES participants were
selected on the basis of a national probability design. In order to increase
the number of participants for specific demographic groups, a multi-stage,
unequal probability of selection design was implemented. The NHANES
oversamples African Americans, Mexican Americans, low income persons,
adolescents 12-19 years, and persons 60 years and older. Sample weights are
constructed that encompass the unequal probabilities of selection, as well as
adjustments for non-participation by selected sample persons. In order to
produce national, representative estimates, the appropriate sample weights
must be used.

For the 2005-2006 NHANES, there were 12,862 persons selected; of these 9950
were considered respondents to the MEC examination and data collection.
However, only 9349 of the MEC respondents provided complete dietary intakes
for Day 1. Furthermore, of those providing the Day 1 data, only 8429 provided
complete dietary intakes for Day 2.

Most analyses of NHANES data use data collected in the MEC and the variable
WTMEC2YR should be used for the sample weights. However, for the WWEIA dietary
data, different sample weights are recommended for analysis. Although attempts
are made to schedule MEC exams uniformly throughout the week, proportionally
more exams occur on weekend days than on weekdays. Because food intake can
vary by day of the week, use of the MEC weights would disproportionately
represent intakes on weekends.

A set of weights WTDRD1 is provided that should be used when an analysis uses
the Day 1 dietary recall data (either alone or when Day 1 nutrient data are
used in conjunction with MEC data). The set of weights WTDRD1 is applicable to
the 9349 respondents with Day 1 data. Day 1 weights were constructed by taking
the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting for (a) the additional
non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day of the week for the
dietary intake data collection. These Day 1 weights are more variable than the
MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated standard errors
using Day 1 data and Day 1 weights are larger than standard errors for similar
estimates based on MEC weights.

When analysis is based on both days of dietary intake, only 8429 sample
persons have valid data. The NHANES protocol requires an attempt to collect
the second day of dietary data at least 3 days after the first day, but the
actual number of days between the two interviews is variable. A set of
adjusted weights, WTDR2D, is to be used only when analysis uses both Day 1 and
Day 2 dietary data. This two-day weight was constructed for the 8429
respondents by taking the Day 1 weights (WTDRD1) and further adjusting for (a)
the additional non-response for the second recall and (b) for the proportion
of weekend-weekday combinations of Day 1 and Day 2 recalls.

Note that all sample weights are person-level weights and each set of dietary
weights should sum to the same population control total as the MEC weights
(WTMEC2YR). In addition, the MEC weights (WTMEC2YR) are appropriate for use in
the analysis of the fish and shellfish consumption data (i.e., variables
DRD340, DRD350A-K, DRD350AQ-JQ DRD360, DRD370A-V, and DRD370AQ-UQ) located in
the Day 1 Total Nutrient Intake File (DR1TOT_D), if no other dietary data are
included in the analysis. Additional explanation of sample weights and
appropriate uses are included in the NHANES Analytic Guidelines. Please also
refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on other analytic issues

## Appendix 3. Adding Food Code Descriptions or Modification Code Descriptions
to Your Files

Two technical support files are included with the Individual Foods files: the
Food Code Description file (DRXFCD_D) and the Modification Code Description
file (DRXMCD_D).

The DRXFCD_D file includes abbreviated descriptions (up to 60 characters) and
complete descriptions (up to 200 characters) associated with each USDA food
code identified in the Individual Foods files. The DRXMCD_D file includes
descriptions associated with each modification code identified in the
Individual Foods files.

The Food Code Description file (DRXFCD_D) contains three variables:

DRDIFDCD a numeric value corresponding to DR1IFDCD in the file  
DR1IFF_D or DR2IFDCD in the file DR2IFF_D;  
DRXFCSD a short description (up to 60 characters) of the food code.  
DRXFCLD a long description (up to 200 characters) of the food code.

The Modification Code Description file (DRXMCD_D) contains two variables:

DRDMC a numeric value corresponding to DR1MC in the file DR1IFF_D or  
DR2MC in the file DR2IFF_D;  
DRMCD a description (up to 200 characters) of the modification code.

The following SQL code is an example of appending the modifications code
description (here called DR1MCD) to one of the Individual Foods files. This
code is for SAS® Proc SQL. Other SQL implementations may be different. This
same technique may be used for the Food Code Description file as well.

create table dr1iff_d_plus as  
select a.*,b.drxmcd as dr1mcd  
from nhanes.dr1iff_d a  
left join  
nhanes.drxmcd_d b  
on a.dr1mc = b.drxmc  
order by seqn , dr1iline;

SAS® users may wish to use Proc Format to assign labels to the food codes or
to the modification codes. The following example assigns a permanent format to
the food code based on the short description. It is assumed that the user has
stored the Individual Foods files and the Food Code Description file in a
library called NHANES and wishes to store the formats there as well.

Options FmtSearch = (NHANES);

Data DRXFMT;  
Set NHANES.DRXFCD_D;  
Retain FMTNAME 'DRIFDCD';  
Rename DRDIFDCD = Start;  
Rename DRXFCSD = Value;  
Drop DRXFCLD; Run;
