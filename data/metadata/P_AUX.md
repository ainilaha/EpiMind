## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

The audiometry examination component (AUX) consists of four parts:

1) Pre-exam audiometric questions - a series of questions to identify
conditions that would affect how audiometric testing is conducted, or how
results are interpreted. Questions include whether the participant has
pressure equalization (ear) tubes, a current cold or earache, exposure to loud
noise or music through earphones in the past 24 hours, or perceived asymmetry
between ears. NOTE: more extensive data relating to a survey participant's
hearing status and history of noise exposure are contained in the audiometry
questionnaire (AUQ) section of the NHANES Sample Person Questionnaire.

2) Otoscopy - a brief otoscopic screening (physical) exam of the ear canals
and eardrums to identify abnormalities, which would require alternate
audiometric procedures or influence interpretation of test results, and to
identify conditions which might require medical referral. The exam screened
for excessive or impacted ear cerumen (wax), physical abnormalities, or
collapsing external ear canals.

3) Middle ear testing - a measurement of eardrum compliance by placing a probe
with a rubber tip into the entrance of the ear canal. It is used to identify
middle ear pathologies that might contribute to a hearing loss. There are
three middle ear tests: tympanometry, wideband reflectance, and acoustic
reflex. The P_AUX data file consists of tympanometric quantitative measurement
variables for middle ear volume, pressure, compliance, and gradient. It also
includes tympanogram quality rating and score variables. The raw data for the
participant's tympanometric curves (P_AUXTYM), wideband reflectance curves
(P_AUXWBR), and acoustic reflex curves (P_AUXAR) are released separately.

4) Pure tone air conduction audiometry - a measurement of hearing sensitivity
conducted by presenting pure tone signals to the ear through earphones and
varying the intensity of the signals until a participant's hearing threshold
at that frequency is determined. Testing is performed at frequencies across
the range of human hearing.

## Eligible Sample

All participants aged 6-19 years and 70 years and older in the NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample were eligible. There were no precluding
conditions for any part of the audiologic exam. However, participants using
hearing aids who were not able to remove them for testing and participants who
had sufficient ear pain at the time of the exam that they could not tolerate
headphones were excluded.

## Protocol and Procedure

All audiometry exam sections were performed by trained examiners on
participants in a dedicated sound-isolating room in the Mobile Examination
Center (MEC). Hearing threshold testing was conducted on both ears of
participants at seven frequencies. Children aged 6-11 years were tested in the
following frequency order so that data could be obtained for more important
frequencies first in case the child's attention waned before all frequencies
could be completed: Ear 1: 1000, 2000, 1000 (repeat), 4000, 8000 Hz. Ear 2:
1000, 2000, 1000 (repeat), 4000, 8000, 6000, 3000, 500 Hz. Ear 1: 6000, 3000,
500 Hz. Adolescents aged 12-19 years and adults aged 70 years and older were
tested in the frequency order 1000, 500, 1000 (repeat), 2000, 3000, 4000,
6000, 8000 Hz for ear 1 and then for ear 2. The ear tested first was varied to
prevent biasing the data. However, if the participant indicated one ear
hearing better than the other, the ear with better sensitivity was tested
first. Testing was conducted according to a modified Hughson Westlake
procedure using the automated testing mode of the audiometer. The approximate
audiometer output constraints for standard and insert earphones was 100
decibels (dB) at 500 to 6000 Hz and 90 dB at 8000 Hz. Some earphones might
produce slightly higher output than others. A threshold greater than 90 dB can
be obtained using a manual testing mode. Observed values, therefore, varied
between -10 and 110 dB. If a participant did not respond to the signal tone at
any level for one or more frequencies because of deafness or severe hearing
loss, a code value of 666 was entered. Manual testing was conducted on
children aged 6-8 years. Manual testing was also conducted when the
participant could not operate the response switch or responded too slowly or
inconsistently for the audiometer to accurately record the response.

In some instances, if a pure tone audiometric signal is sufficiently loud, it
can "cross over" and be heard by the opposite ear via bone conduction. When
this occurs, it is difficult to determine if the threshold obtained is truly
the threshold of the test ear, or an artifact of the non-test ear (which may
have better hearing). For the NHANES hearing threshold testing, a crossover
retesting protocol was performed whenever the observed threshold at any given
frequency was poorer in one ear than the other by 25 dB at 500 and 1000 Hz or
40 dB at any higher frequency. Retesting was accomplished using insert
earphones, which are smaller and have less direct contact with the bones of
the head. Thus, a much louder stimulus is required before crossover occurs.
Due to the complexity of the procedure, masking was not employed in the NHANES
audiometry exam.

Procedures-Manual-508.pdf).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

Instrumentation for the audiometry component included an ViAcoustics
Audiometric Research Tool (ART) system with standard TDH-49P headphones and
Etymotic EarTone 3A insert earphones. Interacoustics Titan (middle ear
analyzer) was used to conduct middle ear testing. Ambient noise levels were
measured daily using the ART system and monitored continuously during testing
with a Quest Model BA-202-27 Bioacoustic Simulator. AUX data were entered
directly into the computerized NHANES database system. Data from the ART
system and Interacoustics Titan were captured electronically and uploaded into
the survey information system automatically.

The ART system was used to conduct the pure-tone air conduction hearing test
on survey participants. The ART system is a comprehensive, highly configurable
audiometer designed for the research application. The ART system consists of
dedicated National Instruments hardware and ART software as an audiometer. The
ART software has been programmed to conduct the threshold test automatically.
The system can also be used to conduct a guided manual test, in which the
software suggests the presentation level and threshold determinations using
the same algorithms as the automated test, but signals are presented manually
by the tester, who can override the system suggestions when deemed
appropriate.

The ART system contains an integrated calibration system, called Trident, to
measure the sound levels put out by the system. A G.R.A.S. calibration kit
with couplers for each type of earphones is used in conjunction with Trident
to monitor calibration. ART calibration checks were conducted at the beginning
of each survey location, daily before the exam, and at the end of each survey
location to ensure that the accuracy has not shifted. Daily calibration
procedures included checking the calibration of the G.R.A.S. microphone, the
background noise measurement, an acoustic calibration check to measure the
output and distortion, and a listening check to evaluate tone quality,
attenuator accuracy, headphone cord integrity, and crossover. Calibration
checks were accomplished for each headphone type on alternating days (i.e.,
TDH-49 headphones one day, insert earphones the next). At the beginning and
end of data collection at each survey location, the daily procedures were
conducted on both sets of headphones, along with a linearity check across all
seven test frequencies. In addition to these calibration checks, each ART
system received an exhaustive calibration once a year or whenever unresolvable
problems were discovered during the calibration checks. The calibrations were
accomplished by a certified laboratory to ensure that the calibrations are
traceable to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

An Interacoustics Titan was used to conduct middle ear testing. The physical
volume was checked on the Titan to ensure that it was within the calibration
limits. In addition, the MEC Health Technicians ran a sample test on one ear
to ensure that the unit was producing clear, normal graphs for the tympanogram
and wideband reflectance. The Titan calibration checks were conducted at the
beginning of each survey location, daily before the exam, and at the end each
survey location. The Titan also received an exhaustive NIST-traceable
calibration check annually.

A Bioacoustic Simulator was used to continuously measure the background noise
levels in the audiometric test room during the exam. Pure tone audiometric
testing was not performed if ambient noise levels in the test booth exceeded
maximum permissible levels. The microphones and sound measurement function of
the bioacoustic simulator were checked by a certified laboratory annually or
whenever unsolvable problems were discovered.

As an additional quality measure, all audiograms, whether conducted in
automated or manual mode, tested the 1000 Hz frequency twice in each ear as a
measure of the reliability of the participant's responses. Pure tone
audiograms were not accepted if there was more than a 10 dB difference between
them.

Tympanometry and/or wideband reflectance measures were sometimes repeated once
per ear when the initial result was unsatisfactory (acoustic reflex testing
was no repeated due to the number of loud tones presented in a single test).
The best of each of the two curves was retained in the data. Subjective
quality ratings for tympanograms are the variables AUAREQC and AUALEQC. These
represent a qualitative assessment of each tympanogram by the consulting
audiologist. The consulting audiologist also scored these tympanograms using a
common classification system developed by Liden (1969) and modified by Jerger
(1970). Two variables AUATYMTR and AUATYMTL provide information about what the
tympanometry results mean in terms of the participant's middle ear status.

The MEC health technicians who performed the audiometry examination component
of NHANES were professionally trained by a certified audiologist from the
National Institute for Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH). NIOSH also
monitored the performance of each health technician on a regular basis. Field
visits to each MEC were conducted by the NIOSH audiologist at least three
times per year. Additionally, NCHS project officers visited the MECs
approximately twice per year to observe the audiometry examinations and verify
that standard testing procedures were being followed. NIOSH consultants
provided the MEC health technicians with annual retraining and protocol
updates.

## Data Processing and Editing

The wording of some questions asked before the audiometry exam has been
simplified for children aged 6-11 years. Therefore, there are two separated
sets of variables for the pre-exam audiometric questionnaire: one for children
aged 6-11 years and another for adolescents aged 12-19 years and adults aged
70 years and older.

All data were captured in the NHANES computerized database system, with
audiometric and middle ear analyzer data automatically uploaded. On a
continuous basis, a consulting audiologist performed a clinical review of all
data for each participant as it was received, checking for quality and
consistency. In addition, a computerized data editing program was developed to
check for logical inconsistencies in the data and technician errors, and to
cross-check other issues affecting data quality (consistency in identifying
potential instances where crossover effects might have occurred, assurance of
randomization of the initial test ear, etc.). Back-end edits of the data were
performed as needed when errors were detected.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not
nationally representative, these data were combined with data from the
previous cycle (2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting exam sample weights in the demographic file should be used to
calculate estimates from the combined cycles. These exam sample weights are
not appropriate for independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not
yield nationally representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or
the 2019-March 2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for
additional information for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and
for the previous 2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that
2-year cycle.

Audiologic data analysis is a complex procedure and requires a thorough
knowledge of the specialty content area for valid results to be obtained. If
an analyst does not have professional experience in this area, it is
recommended that audiologic consultation be obtained to help formulate and
review the results of the analysis. Data analysts should be especially aware
of the fact that the number "666" in all primary audiometric frequency data
fields (AUXU1K1R through AUXU8KL) as well as in all repeat test frequencies
(AUXR1K1R through AUXR8KL) is a qualitative code for nonresponse at a
particular frequency and does not represent actual measured decibel hearing
threshold values. These nonresponse values should be appropriately edited
prior to any numerical data analysis.

The algorithm for obtaining automated audiometric thresholds has changed
slightly over NHANES cycles since 1999. From 1999-2016, automated thresholds
were obtained using an Interacoustics AD226 audiometer, which defined
threshold as the level at which the subject responded at least 50% of the time
to a minimum of 2 out of 3 trials following ascending or descending
presentations; if a subject responded consistently to the first two
presentations at a given level, a third presentation at that level was not
required. From 2017-2020, automated thresholds were obtained using the
ViAcoustics ART software described above. The ART system defined threshold as
the level at which the subject responded at least 50% of the time to ascending
only signal presentations. In the 2017-2018 cycle, the software was programmed
to require a third signal presentation even if a subject responded
consistently to the first two presentations at a given level. The software was
modified for the 2019-2020 cycle to eliminate the need for a third
presentation when a subject responded consistently to the first two
presentations at a given level.

The algorithm for obtaining manual audiometric thresholds has been unchanged
since 1999. Threshold for manual audiometry was defined based on ascending
presentations only following a minimum of two out of three responses. A third
presentation was not required when a subject responded consistently to the
first two presentations at a given level. This threshold definition is
identical to the automated threshold determination algorithm used in the
2019-2020 cycle.

An internal analysis of response histories from a separate study indicated
that inclusion of descending presentations toward threshold shifted the center
point of the psychometric function by less than 2.5 dB, indicating that the
influence of descending responses on center and width is very small for tests
using the Hughson-Westlake procedure. Analysis also found that requiring the
third ascending response resulted in a different threshold determination
approximately 9% of the time, typically better by 5 dB. Thus, the differing
threshold algorithms used across NHANES from 1999-2020 should have minimal
impact on results over time. Nonetheless, analysts should be aware of these
differences when comparing thresholds across various NHANES cycles.

NHANES thresholds in cycles prior to 1999 were all obtained manually using
various threshold search procedures. Analysts comparing back to cycles prior
to 1999 should refer to the data documentation from the earlier surveys to
understand how differences in procedures could affect the thresholds obtained.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
online [NHANES Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

The NHANES audiometry exam also collected the Words-In-Noise data in
2019-March 2020 as a convenience sample file, AUXW_R (Audiometry - Words-In-
Noise), available through the [NCHS RDC](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).
