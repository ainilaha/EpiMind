### Phthalates and Plasticizers Metabolites - Urine (PHTHTE_I)

####  Data File: PHTHTE_I.xpt

##### First Published: October 2018

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and
harder to break. They are often called plasticizers. Some phthalates are used
as solvents (dissolving agents) for other materials. They are used in many
products, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, detergents, lubricating oils,
automotive plastics, plastic clothes (raincoats), and personal-care products
(soaps, shampoos, hair sprays, and nail polishes). Phthalates are used widely
in polyvinyl chloride plastics, which are used to make products such as
plastic packaging film and sheets, garden hoses, inflatable toys, blood-
storage containers, and medical tubing. 1,2-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid,
diisononyl ester (DINCH) is used as a replacement of some high molecular
weight phthalates. Once phthalates or DINCH enter a person's body, they are
converted into breakdown products (metabolites) that pass out quickly in
urine. Biomeasures of phthalates and phthalates alternatives in humans are
necessary to evaluate potential human health effects from exposure to these
chemicals.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible and participants
aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The test principle utilizes high performance liquid chromatography-
electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for the
quantitative detection in urine of the following metabolites: monoethyl
phthalate (MEP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP),
mono(3-carboxypropyl) phthalate (MCPP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP),
monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), monoisononyl phthalate (MNP),
mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl)
phthalate (MEHHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP),
monocarboxyoctyl phthalate (MCOP), monocarboxynonyl phthalate (MCNP), and
cyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid-mono (hydroxy-isononyl) ester (MHNCH)
(Silva, et al., 2007). Urine samples are processed using enzymatic
deconjugation of the glucuronidated metabolites followed by on-line solid
phase extraction (SPE) coupled with reversed phase HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Assay
precision is improved by incorporating isotopically labeled internal standards
of the phthalate metabolites and MHNCH. In addition, 4-methyl umbelliferyl
glucuronide is used to monitor deconjugation efficiency. This selective method
allows for rapid detection of metabolites of commonly used phthalates and
DINCH in human urine with limits of detection in the low ng/mL range.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Phthalates and Phthalate Alternative
Metabolites](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/labmethods/PHTHTE_I_MET.pdf)
(October 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Specimen vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â20Â°C) conditions until
they are shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels are
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed by NCHS for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are
required to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciencesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

****Urinary metals were measured in a full sample of participants ages 3-5 and
a one third subsample of persons 6 years and older. Special sample weights are
required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

****Demographic and Other Related Variables****

****The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES[2015-2016
Demographic
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
File contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended
procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables
(SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
Albumin & Creatinine \- Urine.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
âAlbumin & Creatinine â Urineâ.

**Detection Limits**

****The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in âLCâ (ex., URDCNPLC) indicates whether the result was below the limit
of detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDCNPLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex.,
URXCNP) provides the analytic result for the analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for the phthalates and
plasticizers metabolites:
