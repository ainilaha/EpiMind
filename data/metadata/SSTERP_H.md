## Component Description

Terpenes and their derivatives are common tropospheric trace gases (Graedel,
1979). They are emitted by many species of vegetation and are best known as
the group of compounds responsible for the pleasant and distinctive odor of
pine forests. Most vegetation emits an array of volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) (Geron et. al., 2000). The major components of conifer-derived VOCs are
monoterpenes (MTs), such as α-pinene, β-pinene, β-myrcene, Δ-3-carene, and
limonene. According to the documented physicochemical properties of MTs (Falk
A et. al., 1990) they are sparingly soluble in water but are soluble in blood
and lipophilic tissues. Α\- and β-Pinene dominate emissions from conifer
trees; and research investigations have raised concerns regarding the
physiological effect of α-pinene on humans (Nielsen et. al., 2005; Falk A.A.
et. al., 1990). Exposure to high concentrations of α-pinene (10-450 mg/m3)
causes an increase in its concentration in the blood (Falk A.A. et. al., 1990)
and human metabolism of α-pinene has also been documented (Levin, 1996; Vanek
et. al., 2005). Terpenes are also a major component of plant resins (Paduch
et. al., 2007). In plants they function as infochemicals, attractants, or
repellents, as they are responsible for the typical fragrance of many plants
(Crowell, 1997; Theis et. al., 2003). In addition, terpenes are added to
e-cigarette fluids as flavor chemicals (Tierney et. al., 2016).

There is concern for potential health impacts of secondary organic compounds
formed via terpene oxidation reactions (Rohr, 2013). These compounds exhibit
active indoor air chemistry (ozone-initiated terpene chemistry), resulting in
highly reactive intermediates that can exacerbate susceptible populations. For
example, α-pinene and limonene are commonly found in air fresheners and
cleaning products. One study in an experimental room with cleaning products
reported 1-hour concentrations of individual terpenoids ranging from 10 to
1,300 μg/m3 (1.8-234 ppb) (Singer et. al., 2006). The presence of these
terpenes in high concentrations present a potential hazard due to their
reactivity with ozone. The main reaction products of α-pinene/ozone reactions
are formaldehyde and other aldehydes, such as pinonaldehyde (Grosjean et. al.,
1992).

Many of the terpene/ozone reaction products are asthma triggers; terpenes are
a significant factor in the initiation, exacerbation, and propagation of some
cases of chemical sensitivity. Studies performed on health-care personnel and
professional cleaners working in hospitals have shown an increased risk of
work-related asthma due to the exposure to traditional cleaning agents (e.g.,
detergents), especially if cleaning agents and disinfectants are used in their
sprayed form (Dumas et. al., 2012). In Asia and Europe, nurses have shown an
increased risk of hospitalization for asthma and new-onset asthma if exposed
to cleaning agents (Dumas et. al., 2012).

The MTs α-pinene and β-pinene are irritating to skin and mucous membranes and
can cause both allergic and non-allergic contact dermatitis (Parmeggiani,
1984; Pirila et. al., 1958). Few studies have investigated whether the ability
of terpenes to facilitate chemical absorption correlates with increased
irritation potentials. However, studies (Mandanha et. al., 2013) have
demonstrated that MTs are strong membrane fluidizers in erythrocyte and
fibroblast cells, and the observed effects were not significantly different
among them, suggesting that they possess the same potency in enhancing dermal
permeation. However, there are no reports of serum toxicity for these
terpenes. Falk et. al. (1991) observed a long half-time in blood, indicating
the terpene's affinity for adipose tissues.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method was based on headspace solid phase microextraction coupled to gas
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS/MS) (Silva et. al.,
2018).  This method required the use of 0.50 mL of serum that was spiked with
40 µL of isotopically labeled internal standard before being hermetically
sealed in a 10-mL SPME vial with a Teflon-lined silicone septum. After
automated headspace sampling, the SPME fiber was injected into the GC inlet to
undergo separation using a DB-624 column. The eluates were ionized at 70eV in
the electron source of the mass spectrometer. The tandem mass spectrometer ran
in Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode where the precursor ions fragmented
with nitrogen gas in the collision cell at a defined electron voltage. The
resultant product ions registered an interpretable signal via the electron
multiplier. The relative response ratio (native to internal standard signal)
was compared with a calibration curve of known standards to quantitate the
concentration of the individual terpene in the matrix.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf)[.](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf)
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill et. al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. Additionally, availability of specimens for surplus projects
is lower than for other laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. The
specimen availability can also vary by age or other population
characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data in the
dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor variables
used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting for item
non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the [NHANES
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)[Analytic
Guidelines ](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)and the
on-line [NHANES
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)[Tutorial
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)for details on the
use of sample weights and analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

The analytes included in this dataset were measured in a one-third subsample
of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample,
WTSSTP2Y, are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data. The sample weights created for this file used the examination
sample weight, i.e., WTMEC2YR, as the base weight. The base weight was
adjusted for additional nonresponse to these lab tests and re-poststratified
to the population total using sex, age, and race and Hispanic origin.
Participants who were part of the eligible population but did not provide a
serum specimen, did not have sufficient volume of biospecimens, or did not
give consent for their specimens to be used for future research are included
in the file; however, they have a sample weight assigned "0" in their records.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)[
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in
"L" (ex., SSSAPNL) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable (ex., SSSAPN) provides the analytic result for the analyte. For
analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection (ex.,
SSSAPNL =1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results field.
This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root of 2
(LLOD/sqrt [2]). All data are rounded to three significant figures or the
precision of the LLOD, whichever is less precise.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for SSSAPN, SSSBPN, and SSSLIM
are:

Variable Name | SAS Label | LLOD  
---|---|---  
SSSAPN | a-Pinene (ng/mL) | 0.0500  
SSSBPN | ß-Pinene (ng/mL) | 0.0560  
SSSLIM | Limonene (ng/mL) | 0.162
