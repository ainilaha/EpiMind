### Arsenic - Total - Urine - Special Sample (UTASS_I)

####  Data File: UTASS_I.xpt

##### First Published: June 2018

##### Last Revised: February 2022

## Component Description

Arsenic is widely distributed in the earth's crust and is found most often in
ground water rather than surface water. People encounter arsenic in many
chemical forms that vary greatly in toxicity. The most toxic of the naturally
occurring arsenic compounds are inorganic forms of arsenic and their
methylated metabolites. Less toxic are the organic arsenic compounds. Although
this method does not reveal the chemical form of arsenic to which a person is
exposed, it is sensitive enough to screen urine specimens rapidly from people
thought to be exposed to arsenic or to evaluate total environmental or other
total non-occupational exposure to arsenic.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 18 years and older, who met the regular one-third subsample
selection criteria, were included in this special subsample. Additionally, to
oversample adult smokers, those participants aged 18 years and older, not in
the regular one-third subsample, who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their
entire lifetime (SMQ020=1) and now smoke cigarettes every day (SMQ040=1), were
also included in this special subsample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The method described in this manual assesses arsenic exposure by analyzing
urine through the use of inductively coupled-plasma dynamic reaction cell-mass
spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS). Urine is analyzed because urinary excretion is the
major pathway for eliminating arsenic from the mammalian body (Vahter ME,
1988). This method achieves rapid and accurate quantification of total urinary
arsenic.

Total urine arsenic concentrations are determined by using ICP-DRC-MS. This
multi-element analytical technique is based on quadrupole ICP-MS technology
(Date AR et al., 1989) and includes DRC™ technology (Tanner SD et al., 1999),
which minimizes or eliminates much argon-based polyatomic interference.
Coupling radio frequency power into a flowing argon stream seeded with
electrons creates the plasma, the heat source, which is ionized gas suspended
in a magnetic field. Predominant species in the plasma are positive argon ions
and electrons. Diluted urine samples are converted into an aerosol by using a
nebulizer inserted within a spray chamber. A portion of the aerosol is
transported through the spray chamber and then through the central channel of
the plasma, where it is exposed to temperatures of 6000-8000 ºK. This thermal
energy atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating
at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer,
which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer permits
detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio in rapid sequence, which allows
the determination of individual isotopes of an element. Once inside the mass
spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion optics, then through DRC™, and
finally through the mass-analyzing quadrupole before being detected as they
strike the surface of the detector. The ion optics uses an electrical field to
focus the ion beam into the DRC™. The DRC™ component is pressurized with an
appropriate reaction gas and contains a quadrupole. In the DRC™, elimination
or reduction of argon-based polyatomic interferences takes place through the
interaction of the reaction gas with the interfering polyatomic species in the
incoming ion beam. The quadrupole in the DRC™ allows elimination of unwanted
reaction by-products that would otherwise react to form new interferences.
Electrical signals, resulting from the detection of the ions, are processed
into digital information that is used to indicate the intensity of the ions,
and subsequently the concentration of the element. In this method, arsenic
(isotope mass 75) and gallium (isotope mass 71) is measured in urine by ICP-
DRC-MS, using argon/hydrogen (90%/10%, respectively) as a reaction gas
(Neubauer K. et al., 1999). Urine samples are diluted 1:9 with 2% (v/v)
double-distilled nitric acid containing gallium or tellurium for internal
standardization.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Urinary Metals and Total Arsenic Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/labmethods/UTAS_UTASS_UM_UMS_I_MET.PDF)
(June 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).  
  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**  
  
Urinary total arsenic was measured in a one-third subsample of persons 18
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.  
  
**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
Albumin & Creatinine - Urine.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).  
  
**Detection Limits**  
  
The detection limits were constant in the data set. Two variables are provided
for each of these analytes. The variable name ending in "LC" (ex., URDUASLC)
indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection: "0" means that
the result was at or above the limit of detection, "1" indicates that the
result was below the limit of detection. For analytes with analytic results
below the lower limit of detection (ex., URDUASLC=1), an imputed fill value
was placed in the analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of
detection divided by square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]). The other variable
prefixed URX (ex., URXUAS) provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for total arsenic is:

**Variable Name** |  **SAS Label** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
URXUAS |  Urinary Total Arsenic |  0.26
