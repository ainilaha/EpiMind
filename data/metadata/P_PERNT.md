## Component Description

The NHANES program suspended field operations in March 2020 due to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. As a result, data collection for
the NHANES 2019-2020 cycle was not completed and the collected data are not
nationally representative. Therefore, data collected from 2019 to March 2020
were combined with data from the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle to form a nationally
representative sample of NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data. These data
are available to the public. Please refer to the Analytic Notes section for
more details on the use of the data.

**Urinary Perchlorate**

Perchlorate has been used as an oxidant in solid fuel propellants for rockets
and missiles since the 1950s. Lesser amounts of perchlorate are used in
matches and fireworks. Perchlorate can also form naturally in the environment
and can accumulate in nitrate-rich mineral deposits mined for use in
fertilizers. Drinking water, milk, and certain plants with high water content
(e.g., lettuce) can be the main sources of perchlorate intake for humans.
Perchlorate has been used medically to treat hyperthyroidism. Its inhibitory
effect on thyroid hormone production has led to concerns that exposure even to
low levels of perchlorate in the environment might affect vulnerable groups,
such as pregnant women with inadequate iodine intake and infants for whom
thyroid hormone levels must be maintained adequately for normal brain
development. Perchlorate taken into the body is rapidly eliminated in the
urine, within a matter of hours. Measurement of urinary perchlorate is useful
to assess recent human exposure.

**Urinary Nitrate and Thiocyanate**

Nitrate and thiocyanate are polyatomic anions that can disrupt thyroid
function by competitively inhibiting iodide uptake, similar to the action of
perchlorate. Nitrate, thiocyanate, and perchlorate can reversibly bind to the
sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) protein resulting in reduced iodine absorption
by the thyroid. Nitrate, thiocyanate, and perchlorate interact additively to
impair iodide uptake by the thyroid. Therefore, assessment of the impact of
perchlorate exposure on thyroid function should include assessment of nitrate
and thiocyanate exposure. By assessing exposure to each of the three
physiologically relevant NIS-inhibitors, the relative impact of each chemical
on thyroid function can be estimated and appropriate regulatory action taken
if exposures are negatively impacting thyroid hormone levels. Impaired thyroid
function can lead to hypothyroidism, proliferative thyroid lesions, and
impaired neurodevelopment in infants.

Nitrate poisoning can also lead to methemoglobinemia, primarily in infants.
The prevalence of nitrate exposure is likely due to nitrate intake from both
food and drinking water, with foods (e.g., vegetables, milk, dairy products)
thought to account for the majority of nitrate intake for typical American
adults. Nitrate anion can also form endogenously. Public health prevention
efforts have reduced the prevalence of methemoglobinemia in the United States.
A reference range for urinary nitrate will provide useful information relevant
to nitrate poisoning and subclinical methemoglobinemia in the U.S.

Thiocyanate is also a biomarker of cyanide exposure from tobacco smoke or
diet. Thiocyanate primarily forms in the body as a metabolite of cyanide from
tobacco smoke or cyanogenic foods, such as cassava. Exposure to toxic levels
of cyanide can result from numerous chemical reactions. Lower levels of
thiocyanate can also be found in milk, dairy products, and some vegetables.
Therefore, a defined reference range for thiocyanate will provide useful
benchmark data in case of a cyanide exposure event.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years and a one-third subsample of
examined participants aged 6 years and older were eligible in the NHANES
2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic sample.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure for the measurement of nitrate,
perchlorate, and thiocyanate in human urine using ion chromatography coupled
with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation is
achieved using an IonPac AS16 column with sodium hydroxide as the eluent. The
eluent from the column is ionized using an electrospray interface to generate
and transmit negative ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative
response factors (ratio of native analyte to stable isotope labeled internal
standard) with known standard concentrations yields individual analyte
concentrations.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf)
and [2019-2020 NHANES Laboratory Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2019-2020/manuals/2020-MEC-
Laboratory-Procedures-Manual-508.pdf). Vials were stored under appropriate
frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they were shipped to National Center for
Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the QC
procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment operation,
specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and constructive
feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining sessions are
conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a QC protocol for all CDC and contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et. al.,
1981) when testing NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' QA/QC
performance criteria for accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules
(Caudill, et. Al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

The COVID-19 pandemic required suspension of NHANES 2019-2020 field operations
in March 2020 after data were collected in 18 of the 30 survey locations in
the 2019-2020 sample. Data collection was cancelled for the remaining 12
locations. Because the collected data from 18 locations were not nationally
representative, these data were combined with data from the previous cycle
(2017-2018) to create a 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file. A special
weighting process was applied to the 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data file.
The resulting sample weights in the present file should be used to calculate
estimates from the combined cycles. The sample weights are not appropriate for
independent analyses of the 2019-2020 data and will not yield nationally
representative results for either the 2017-2018 data alone or the 2019-March
2020 data alone. Please refer to the NHANES website for additional information
for the NHANES 2017-March 2020 pre-pandemic data, and for the previous
2017-2018 public use data file with specific weights for that 2-year cycle.

Refer to the
[2017-2018](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
and [2019-2020 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2019)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing
data in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any
predictor variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-
weighting for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

Perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate in urine were measured in a one-third
subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample weights are
required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

The analytes included in this dataset were measured for all examined
participants aged 3 to 5 years, and in a one-third subsample of participants 6
years and older. For participants aged 3 to 5 their WTSAPRP are equivalent to
their MEC exam sample weights. These participants have completed at least one
physical exam component in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample
weight larger than "0," regardless of their lab test results. For participants
6 years and older, special sample weights were created for the subsample.
These special weights accounted for the additional probability of selection
into the subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if participant 6 years and older were selected as part of the one-
third subsample, but did not provide a urine specimen, they would have the
sample weight value assigned as "0" in their record.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-March 2020 Pre-
Pandemic Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&Cycle=2017-2020)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
ending in "LC" (ex., URDUP8LC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUP8) provides the analytic
result for that analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex., URDUP8LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]).

**The lower limits of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for urinary perchlorate,
nitrate, and thiocyanate:**
