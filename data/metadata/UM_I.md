# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2015-2016 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Metals - Urine (UM_I)

####  Data File: UM_I.xpt

##### First Published: June 2018

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Trace metals have been associated with adverse health effects in occupational
studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in general
population groups.

This method is used to achieve rapid and accurate quantifications of multiple
elements of toxicological and nutritional interest. The method is sensitive
and rapid enough to analyze urine specimens from subjects suspected of being
exposed to a number of important toxic elements, or to evaluate environmental
or other non-occupational exposure to these same elements.  

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible and participants
aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method directly measures multiple metals in urine specimens using mass
spectrometry after a simple dilution sample preparation step. Liquid samples
are introduced into the mass spectrometer through the inductively coupled
plasma (ICP) ionization source, reduced to small droplets in an argon aerosol
via a nebulizer, and then the droplets enter the ICP. The ions first pass
through a focusing region, followed by the dynamic reaction cell (DRC), the
quadrupole mass filter, and finally are selectively counted in rapid sequence
at the detector allowing individual isotopes of an element to be determined.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.  

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.  

## Laboratory Method Files

[Urinary Metals and Total Arsenic Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/labmethods/UTAS_UTASS_UM_UMS_I_MET.PDF)
(June 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of Laboratory
Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.  

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) used when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.  

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciencesâ quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015-2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights  
** Urinary metals were measured in a full sample of participants ages 3-5 and
a one-third subsample of participants 6 years and older. Special sample
weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights
for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used when
analyzing these data.

****Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
** The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the
appropriate survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2015-2016
Demographic
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
File contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended
procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables
(SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
Albumin & Creatinine \- Urine.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits  
** The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in âLCâ (ex., URDUBALC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value â0â means that the result was at or above
the limit of detection, â1â indicates that the result was below the limit
of detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDUBALC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the
square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUBA)
provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in Âµg/L) for the urinary metals in the
data set is:

Variable Name | SAS Label | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URXUBA | Urinary Barium | 0.060  
URXUCD | Urinary Cadmium | 0.036  
URXUCS | Urinary Cesium | 0.086  
URXUCO | Urinary Cobalt | 0.023  
URXUMN | Urinary Manganese | 0.130  
URXUMO | Urinary Molybdenum | 0.800  
URXUPB | Urinary Lead | 0.030  
URXUSB | Urinary Antimony | 0.022  
URXUSR | Urinary Strontium | 2.340  
URXUTL | Urinary Thallium | 0.018  
URXUSN | Urinary Tin | 0.090  
URXUTU | Urinary Tungsten | 0.018  
URXUUR | Urinary Uranium | 0.002   
  
Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
