### Arsenics - Total & Speciated - Urine - Special Sample (UASS_G)

####  Data File: UASS_G.xpt

##### First Published: September 2013

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Arsenic is widely distributed in the earthâs crust and is found most often
in ground water rather than surface water. People encounter arsenic in many
chemical forms that vary greatly in toxicity. The most toxic of the naturally-
occurring arsenic compounds are inorganic forms of arsenic and their
methylated metabolites. Less toxic are the organic arsenic compounds. Although
this method does not reveal the chemical form of arsenic to which a person is
exposed, it is sensitive enough to screen urine specimens rapidly from people
thought to be exposed to arsenic or to evaluate total environmental or other
total non-occupational exposure to arsenic.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 20 years and older who met the regular one-third subsample
selection criteria were included in the adult special subsample.
Additionally, to augment the adult special subsample, those survey
participants aged 20 years and older, not in the regular one-third subsample,
who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their entire lifetime (SMQ020=1) and now
smoke cigarettes every day (SMQ040=1), were also eligible as an oversampling
of smokers.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**1\. Total arsenic**

The method described in this manual assesses arsenic exposure by analyzing
urine through the use of inductively coupled-plasma dynamic reaction cell-mass
spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS). Urine is analyzed because urinary excretion is the
major pathway for eliminating arsenic from the mammalian body (Vahter ME,
1988). This method achieves rapid and accurate quantification of total urinary
arsenic.

Total urine arsenic concentrations are determined by using ICP-DRC-MS. This
multielement analytical technique is based on quadrupole ICP-MS technology
(Date AR et al., 1989) and includes DRC™ technology (Tanner SD et al. , 1999),
which minimizes or eliminates much argon-based polyatomic interference.
Coupling radio frequency power into a flowing argon stream seeded with
electrons creates the plasma, the heat source, which is ionized gas suspended
in a magnetic field. Predominant species in the plasma are positive argon ions
and electrons. Diluted urine samples are converted into an aerosol by using a
nebulizer inserted within a spray chamber. A portion of the aerosol is
transported through the spray chamber and then through the central channel of
the plasma, where it is exposed to temperatures of 6000-8000 ºK. This thermal
energy atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating
at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer,
which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer permits
detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio in rapid sequence, which allows
the determination of individual isotopes of an element. Once inside the mass
spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion optics, then through DRC™, and
finally through the mass-analyzing quadrupole before being detected as they
strike the surface of the detector. The ion optics uses an electrical field to
focus the ion beam into the DRC™. The DRC™ component is pressurized with an
appropriate reaction gas and contains a quadrupole. In the DRC™, elimination
or reduction of argon-based polyatomic interferences takes place through the
interaction of the reaction gas with the interfering polyatomic species in the
incoming ion beam. The quadrupole in the DRC™ allows elimination of unwanted
reaction by-products that would otherwise react to form new interferences.
Electrical signals, resulting from the detection of the ions, are processed
into digital information that is used to indicate the intensity of the ions,
and subsequently the concentration of the element. In this method, arsenic
(isotope mass 75) and gallium (isotope mass 71) or tellurium (isotope mass
126) is measured in urine by ICP-DRC-MS, using argon/hydrogen (90%/10%,
respectively) as a reaction gas (Neubauer K. et al., 1999). Urine samples are
diluted 1:9 with 2% (v/v) double-distilled nitric acid containing gallium or
tellurium for internal standardization.

**2\. Speciated arsenics**

 (arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, trimethylarsine oxide, monomethylarsonic acid,
dimethylarsinic acid, arsenous (III) acid, arsenic (V) acid)

The concentration of speciated arsenics is determined by using high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate the species coupled to an
ICP-DRC-MS to detect the arsenic species. This analytical technique is based
on separation by anion-exchange chromatography (IC), followed by detection
using quadrupole ICP-MS technology, and includes DRC™ technology (Baranov VI
et al., 1999), which minimizes or eliminates many argon-based polyatomic
interferences (Tanner S et al., 2000) will require 0.5 mL of urine. Arsenic
species column separation is largely achieved due to differences in charge-
charge interactions of each negatively-charged arsenic component in the mobile
phase, with the positively-charged quaternary ammonium groups bound at the
column's solid-liquid interface. Upon exit from the column, the
chromatographic eluent goes through a nebulizer, where it is converted into an
aerosol upon entering the spray chamber.

Carried by a stream of argon gas, a portion of the aerosol is transported
through the spray chamber and then through the central channel of the plasma,
where it is heated to temperatures of 6000-8000° K. This thermal energy
atomizes and ionizes the sample. The ions and the argon enter the mass
spectrometer through an interface that separates the ICP, which is operating
at atmospheric pressure (approximately 760 torr), from the mass spectrometer,
which is operating at approximately 10-5 torr.

The mass spectrometer permits detection of ions at each mass-to-charge ratio
in rapid sequence, which allows the determination of individual isotopes of an
element. Once inside the mass spectrometer, the ions pass through the ion
optics, then through the DRC™, and finally through the mass-analyzing
quadrupole before being detected as they strike the surface of the detector.
The ion optics uses an electrical field to focus the ion beam into the DRC™.

The DRC™ component is pressurized with an appropriate reaction gas and
contains a quadrupole. In the DRC™, elimination or reduction of argon-based
polyatomic interferences takes place through the interaction of the reaction
gas with the interfering polyatomic species in the incoming ion beam. The
quadrupole in the DRC™ allows elimination of unwanted reaction by-products
that would otherwise react to form new interferences.

There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.

Detailed instructions onspecimen collection and processing can be found in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM).

## Data Processing and Editing

The analytical methods are described in the _Description of Laboratory
Methodology_ section above.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures
Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2009-2010/manuals/lab.pdf).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2011-2012 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2011)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

Urinary speciated arsenics were obtained in a smoking subsample of persons 20
years and older. Special sample weights are required to analyze these data
properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this data
file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance Estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the arsenics in the data set.

Lower detection limits for the total and speciated arsenics  
Urinary Total Arsenic 1.25 µg/L  
Urinary Arsenous Acid 0.48 µg/L  
Urinary Arsenic acid 0.87 µg/L  
Urinary Arsenobetaine 1.19 µg/L  
Urinary Arsenocholine 0.28 µg/L  
Urinary Dimethylarsonic Acid 1.8 µg/L  
Urinary Monomethylarsonic Acid 0.89 µg/L  
Urinary Trimethylarsine Oxide 0.25 µg/L

The variable named LBD__LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection. There are two values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at
or above the limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the
limit of detection. In cases where the result was below the limit of
detection, the value for that variable is the detection limit divided by the
square root of two.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
