# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2009-2010 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Sleep Disorders (SLQ_F)

####  Data File: SLQ_F.xpt

#####  First Published: January 2012

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

This is a very limited number of questions on sleep habits and disorders;
significantly reduced from the 2007-2008 NHANES SLQ data release.

## Eligible Sample

Participants 16 years of age and older were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI) system.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire.

## Data Processing and Editing

Edits were made to ensure the completeness, consistency and analytic
usefulness of the data.

## Analytic Notes

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
