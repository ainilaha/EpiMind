### High-sensitivity cardiac troponins (Surplus) (SSTROP_A)

####  Data File: SSTROP_A.xpt

##### First Published: September 2022

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Sera from stored surplus specimens in the NHANES 1999-2004 cycles were tested
for high-sensitivity (hs)-troponin T (Roche), hs-troponin I (Abbott), hs-
troponin I (Siemens) and hs-troponin I (Ortho). The results forâ¯high-
sensitivity cardiac troponin in this data release areâ¯reported in nanograms
per literâ¯(ng/L).â¯â¯â¯

## Eligible Sample

NHANES participants aged 1 year or older who consented to storing their
samples for future research and had stored sera samples from 1999-2004.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This stored specimen study was conducted by the Principal Investigator (PI)
Dr. Elizabeth Selvin at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
All measurements were performed during 2018-2020 at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland (Lab Director: Dr. Robert
Christenson).

**Hs-Troponin T (Roche)**

Hs-troponin T, TnT Gen 5 STAT in the USA, was measured using the Roche Cobas
e601 using Elecsys reagents. The limit of detection (LoD) for this assay is 3
ng/L.

Total imprecision was expressed as coefficients of variation (CVs). They were
3.1% (26.12-31.28 ng/L) and 2.0% (2004.5-2215.5 ng/L).

**Hs-Troponin I (Abbott)**

Hs-troponin I (Abbott) was measured using the Abbott ARCHITECT i2000SR. The
LoD for this assay is 1.7 ng/L.

CVs: 6.4% (8.12-16.01 ng/L), 4.5% (27.69-55.38 ng/L), 3.5% (169.1-314.1 ng/L),
and 6.7% (2758-4444 ng/L).

**Hs-Troponin I (Siemens)**

Hs-troponin I (Siemens), TNIH assay, was measured using the Siemens Centaur
XP. The LoD for this assay is 1.6 ng/L.

CVs: 3.8% (12-28 ng/L), 2.7% (120-280 ng/L), and 2.6% (9000-21000 ng/L).

**Hs-Troponin****I (Ortho)**

Hs-troponin I (Ortho) was measured using the Ortho Vitros 3600. The LoD for
this assay is 0.39 ng/L.

CVs: 4.2% (6-16 ng/L) and 2.8% (17511-21403 ng/L).

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were received after all analyses were complete. The data were not edited.

Very low concentrations of hs-troponin are associated with greater variability
and are not routinely reported for clinical use. However, such values have
been unblinded in this dataset for **research purposes only**.  

For hs-troponin T (Roche) and hs-troponin I (Ortho), low values were initially
blinded for each assay. Such values were subsequently unblinded. If unblinding
was not possible, the hs-troponin T (Roche) value was imputed as 3 ng/L
divided by square root of 2 and the hs-troponin I (Ortho) value was imputed as
0.39 ng/L divided by square root of 2. The hs-troponin I (Siemens) was
initially blinded at values below the limit of quantitation (LoQ). If
unblinding was not possible, the hs-troponin I (Siemens) value was imputed as
2.5 ng/L divided by square root of 2\. For the purposes of this study, the hs-
troponin I (Abbott) was not blinded.

The initial lowest reported value before unblinding, limit of the blank (LoB),
limit of detection (LoD) and limit of quantitation (LoQ) for hs-troponin T
(Roche), hs-troponin I (Abbott), hs-troponin I (Siemens) and hs-troponin I
(Ortho) are:

Analyte | Device | Initial lowest reported value  
before unblinding | LoB | LoD | LoQ  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
Hs-Troponin T | Roche | 3 ng/L | 2.5 ng/L | 3 ng/L | 6 ng/L  
Hs-Troponin I | Abbott | - | 0.9 ng/L | 1.7 ng/L | 2.3 ng/L  
Hs-Troponin I | Siemens | 2.5 ng/L | 0.5 ng/L | 1.6 ng/L | 2.5 ng/L  
Hs-Troponin I | Ortho | 0.39 ng/L | 0.14 ng/L | 0.39 ng/L | 1.23 ng/L  
  

Two variables are provided for each analyte. The variable prefixed SS (i.e.,
SSTNT) provides the analytic result for that analyte. The other variable
prefixed SS and suffixed with "LC" (ex., SSTNTLC) indicates how the analytic
results was obtained: A "0" value means that the result was initially
measurable and not blinded. A "1" indicates that the result was initially
blinded and was able to be unblinded to provide a measured result. A "2"
indicates that the result was initially blinded and was unable to be
unblinded, requiring imputation of the result as documented above. For
analytes with results that are below the manufacturer-reported LoQ, caution is
required for interpretation and values are provided for research purposes
only.

The hs-troponin variable names and its corresponding analyte names are:  

Variable Name | Analyte name  
---|---  
SSTNT | Cardiac hs-Troponin T, ng/L  
SSTNIA | Cardiac hs-Troponin I (Abbott), ng/L  
SSTNIS | Cardiac hs-Troponin I (Siemens), ng/L  
SSTNIO | Cardiac hs-Troponin I (Ortho), ng/L  
  

**Other variables in this dataset:**

An indicator variable (SSPRISTP) is included for whether the analyte was
measured in a pristine sample (never previously thawed and re-frozen): 0=non-
pristine; 1=pristine.

Variable Name | Description  
---|---  
SSTNTLC | Cardiac hs-Troponin T indicator for values less than blinding threshold value  
SSTNIALC | Cardiac hs-Troponin I (Abbott) indicator for greater than/equal or less then LoD  
SSTNISLC | Cardiac hs-Troponin I (Siemens) indicator for values less than blinding threshold value  
SSTNIOLC | Cardiac hs-Troponin I (Ortho) indicator for values less than blinding threshold value  
SSPRISTP | Pristine sample indicator for SSTROP_A  
  

**Subsample Weights**

Sample weights are required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample
weights for this subsample are included in this data file and should be used
when analyzing these data (WTSSCB2Y, WTSSCB4Y). Please refer to the NHANES
[Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues**.**
These sample weights are shared with files: "SSCARD_A" and "SSBNP_A", which
were from the same sample of survey participants.
