### Trichomonas - Urine (TRICH_I)

####  Data File: TRICH_I.xpt

##### First Published: September 2017

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Trichomonas vaginalis infection is the most common curable sexually
transmitted infection among women in the United States; it can cause
inflammation that has been associated with an increased risk of HIV
transmission and acquisition, and low birth weight.

Prevalence in adult men has never been measured in a nationally representative
sample. Trichomonas vaginalis infection is not reportable and so few other
sources exist for obtaining national data.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 14-59 years were eligible. This public data file
only includes examined participants aged 18-59 years. See _Analytic Notes_ for
information on participants aged 14-17 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The GEN-PROBE APTIMA trichomonas vaginalis assay combines the technologies of
target capture, Transcription-Mediated Amplification (TMA), and Dual Kinetic
Assay (DKA).

Specimens are collected and transferred into their respective specimen
transport tubes. The transport solutions in these tubes release the rRNA
targets and protect them from degradation during storage. When the APTIMA
trichomonas vaginalis assay is performed in the laboratory, the target rRNA
molecules are isolated from specimens by the use of capture oligomers in a
method called target capture; magnetic microparticles are another key feature
of target capture. The capture oligomers contain sequences complementary to
specific regions of the target molecules as well as a string of deoxyadenosine
residues. A separate capture oligomer is used for each target. During the
hybridization step, the sequence specific regions of the capture oligomers
bind to specific regions of the target molecules. The capture oligomer: target
complex is then captured out of solution by decreasing the temperature of the
reaction to room temperature. This temperature reduction allows hybridization
to occur between the deoxyadenosine region on the capture oligomer and the
poly-deoxythymidine molecules that are covalently attached to the magnetic
particles. The microparticles, including the captured target molecules bound
to them, are pulled to the side of the reaction vessel using magnets and the
supernatant is aspirated. The particles are washed to remove residual specimen
matrix that may contain amplification reaction inhibitors. After the target
capture steps are completed, the specimens are ready for amplification.

Target amplification assays are based on the ability of complementary
oligonucleotide primers to specifically anneal and allow enzymatic
amplification of the target nucleic acid strands. The GEN-PROBE TMA reaction
replicates a specific region of the small ribosomal subunit from T. vaginalis
via DNA and RNA intermediates and generates RNA amplicon molecules. Detection
of the rRNA amplification product sequences is achieved using nucleic acid
hybridization (HPA). A single-stranded chemiluminescent DNA probe, which is
complementary to a region of the target amplicon, is labeled with different
acridinium ester molecule. The labeled DNA probe combines with amplicon to
form stable RNA: DNA hybrids. The Selection Reagent differentiates hybridized
from unhybridized probe, eliminating the generation of signal from
unhybridized probe. During the detection step, light emitted from the labeled
RNA: DNA hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, and are
reported as Relative Light Units (RLU).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of STD
Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB
Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for
analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to Division of STD Prevention Laboratory for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015 - 2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic Guidelines
](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/survey_methods.htm)and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on the use
of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  
  
The laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data files using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The public release data file includes Trichomonas - urine data for
participants aged 18-59. Trichomonas - urine data for youth aged 14-17 years
are available through the [NCHS Research Data Center
(RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

**Detection Limits**  
Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower LLODs isnât
applicable.  
Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
