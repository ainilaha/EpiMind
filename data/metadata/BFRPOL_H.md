### Brominated Flame Retardants (BFRs) - Pooled Samples (BFRPOL_H)

####  Data File: BFRPOL_H.xpt

##### First Published: May 2018

##### Last Revised: November 2020

## Component Description

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexabromobiphenyl
(PBB-153) are included in a larger group of chemicals known as brominated
flame retardants (BFRs) that are added to products, such as foam padding,
textiles, or plastics to prevent accidental ignition and fire development.
BFRs are not chemically bound to the flame-retarded material, so they can
enter the environment from volatilization, leaching, or degradation of BFR-
containing products. PBDEs are generally persistent in the environment and
have been measured in aquatic sediments, house dust, and aquatic and
terrestrial animals. PBDEs have been shown to bio accumulate in fish. Humans
may be exposed through diet, including breastfeeding, and by contact with BFR-
treated products and contaminated house dust.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 12 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum samples from NHANES 2013-2014 were stored frozen before analysis. Eleven
polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and PBB-153 were measured in serum
using automated liquid/liquid extraction and subsequent sample clean-up. Final
determination of target analytes was performed by isotope dilution gas
chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry GC/IDHRMS. The analytical
method is described in Jones et al., 2012, which is a modification of the
method described by Sjodin et al., 2004.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.

(May 2018)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30oC) conditions until they are
shipped to the National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

            **Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected during "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al., 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences' quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

  

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

  

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2013-2014 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample Weights**

BFRs including PBDEs and PBB-153 were measured in a one-third subsample of
participants 12 years and older. Special sample weights are required to
analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are
included in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

Samples were pooled in groups of 8 samples per pool within 48 demographic
groups. The analysis of NHANES 2013-2014 pooled-sample data must be conducted
with the basic demographic variables provided in this data file. This pooled-
sample data file cannot be linked to other NHANES 2013-2014 data.  Because
each sample person does not have an equal probability of selection, sample
weighting is needed to produce correct population estimates of means,
percentiles, and other descriptive statistics.

The pooled-sample weights required to produce estimates from these data are
included in this data file.  The analysis of pooled-samples from survey data
is a relatively new field of study, and there is currently no established
method to produce design effect adjusted variance estimates for these pooled
results. These data cannot be analyzed using software designed for complex
surveys because design features are not available.

**Rationale and Methods Used to Create Pooled Results**

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides an ongoing
assessment of the U.S. population's exposure to environmental chemicals by
using biomonitoring in conjunction with CDC's National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). Characterizing the distributions of
concentrations of environmental compounds or their metabolites in the U.S.
population is a primary objective of CDC's biomonitoring program.
Historically, this characterization has been based on individual measurements
of these compounds in body fluid or tissue from representative samples of the
population. Pooling samples allows for larger sample volumes, which can result
in lower limits of detection and reduces the number of measurements and costs.
In NHANES 2013-2014, a weighted pooled-sample design was implemented to
facilitate pooling samples before making analytical measurements. Table 1
lists the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) names,
common abbreviation, and NHANES variable name for the analytes included in
this data file.

Pools were prepared from serum collected from a random one-third subsample of
the NHANES 2013-2014 participants aged 12 years and older. Samples were pooled
based on gender, race and Hispanic origin, and age. To implement the pooled-
sample design, each participant sample was identified as belonging to one of
48 demographic groups based on race and Hispanic origin (Mexican American: MA,
Other Hispanic: OH, non-Hispanic white: NHW, non-Hispanic black: NHB, non-
Hispanic Asian: NHA, Other race including multiracial: OTHER), gender (Male,
Female), and age group (12-19, 20-39, 40-59, and 60+ years of age and older).
Eight (8) samples were included in each pool. The number of pools created for
each of the 48 demographic groups varied depending on the total number of
individual samples available in a demographic group. The one-third subsample
of NHANES 2013-2014 represents 2,318 individual samples, but because the
pooled-sample design requires that all samples be of sufficient volume and
that there be the same number of samples in each pool, 2,179 samples were
available to create 284 pools with 8 samples per pool. For NHANES 2013-2014,
due to limited sample size, no pooled sample was formed for males 60 years and
older in the "OTHER" race/Hispanic origin group. Data user needs to be
cautious when making national inference including this population subgroup.
See more details on pool sample formation and exceptions in Table 2. The
variable SAMPLEID denotes the identification number for each pool and ranges
from 1 through 284. Please refer to the Pooled-Sample Technical Support file
(POOLTF_H) for detailed information on individual participants included in
each pool.  

In order to incorporate sample weighting into the pooled-sample design it was
necessary to use a different volume of material from each sample contributing
to a pool. The volume chosen for each sample in a pool was based on the ratio
of its sampling weight to the sum of the sampling weights of all samples in
the pool. To physically accomplish the pooling in the laboratory required that
the ratio of the largest to the smallest sampling weight of samples in the
same pool be no larger than about 10. The individual samples were
sorted/stratified by sampling weight within each of the 48 demographic groups
and pools were formed using samples with sampling weights adjacent to one
another in the sorted list. The number of samples in the one-third subsample,
number of samples available, the number of these samples that were usable, and
the number of pools formed in each demographic group are presented in Table 2.
Once the pools were created, summed sampling weights were further adjusted to
account for the unused samples. These adjusted summed sampling weights are
represented by the variable named WTBSMSMA.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2013-2014/FASTQX_H.htm) includes
auxiliary information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

In the dataset, the whole-weight detection limit (pg/g serum) is a variable
and dependent on the available sample size; however, the variation in sample
size was low. Lipid adjusted detection limits are variable (ng/g lipid) due to
differences of the lipid levels measured in individual pools/specimens. In
cases where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for that
variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of 2.

**Methodological approaches for analysis**

There are a few pooled-sample methodological publications, which address
approaches related to the following topics:

  * Variance estimation and bias correction when pooling samples from log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2010b; Caudill et al., 2007; Li et al., 2014; Mary-Huard, 2007); 

  * Models that incorporate measurement error when analyzing pooled-samples from normally or log-normally distributed populations (Caudill, 2010a; Caudill, 2015); 

  * Incorporation of sample weighting into a pooled-sample design (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a); and

  * Estimation of standard errors and confidence limits for point estimates from pooled-samples (Caudill, 2012; Caudill, 2010a).
