# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2009-2010 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Air Quality (AQQ_F)

####  Data File: AQQ_F.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2011

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Two air quality questions were included in the physical activity questionnaire
(prefix PAQ). The first (PAQ685), asked "During the past 12 months, when you
thought or were informed air quality was bad, did you do anything
differently?". Respondents who answered yes to this question were then asked
what they did differently.



## Eligible Sample

All survey participants 16 or more years of age were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

The questions were asked before the physical examination, in the home, using
the Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing - CAPI (interviewer administered)
system.

## Data Processing and Editing

Limited editing was done on the data. Some other responses (PAQ690o) were re-
coded into the appropriate pre-coded response categories (PAQ690a-j). One new
response category (PAQ690k) was created for responses that mentioned using or
changing an air filter or air cleaner.

Â

## Analytic Notes

Since the questions were asked in the household interview, the interview
sample weights may be used in their analysis. However, if the data is joined
with data from the MEC, the MEC sample weights should be used.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
