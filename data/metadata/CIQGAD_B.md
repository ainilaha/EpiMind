### Mental Health - Generalized Anxiety Disorder (CIQGAD_B)

####  Data File: CIQGAD_B.xpt

#####  First Published: March 2006

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

An NHANES version of three modules from the automated version of the World
Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, Version 2.1
(CIDI-Auto 2.1) was administered during the face-to-face portion of the Mobile
Examination Center (MEC) interview. The CIDI is a comprehensive, fully
standardized interview that is used to assess mental disorders and provide
diagnoses according to definitions and criteria of the tenth revision of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10, World Health Organization
1992, 1993) and the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV, 1994). The CIDI
is especially suitable for large epidemiological studies because it can be
administered by lay interviewers, does not require outside informants or
medical records, and does not assume the presence of a current disorder. It is
used in both clinical and research settings.

The NHANES CIDI, developed as a computer-administered version, consisted of
three diagnostic modules that addressed diagnoses present in the past 12
months. These modules were Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and
Depressive Disorders. Additional questions were added to measure both the
quality and quantity of impairment, and to assess risk factors such as
physical illness and life events. These additional questions were placed at
the end of each module. The modules were administered in either English or
Spanish by a trained interviewer who followed guidelines instituted by the
CIDI Training Centers. These guidelines are included in the MEC Interviewer
Manual, Chapter 6.

## Eligible Sample

The instrument was administered to a half-sample of examination participants,
ages 20 - 39 years. Proxies were ineligible, as were persons who required
interpreters (i.e., non-English or Spanish speakers).

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

MEC private face-to-face interview.

For more information, the Interviewer Procedure Manuals, Exam Manuals, and
Survey Questionnaires can be found on the NHANES website.

## Data Processing and Editing

Questionnaire interview responses were entered by the interviewer on a desktop
computer and then uploaded to the NHANES computerized database in the same
manner as other sections of the MEC interview. In this public release data
file, variables are included for responses to all questions to the instruments
except for checkpoints and questions requiring text entries. All of the
questions from the original instrument were renamed to be consistent with
NHANES naming conventions. The coding patterns for the traditional CIDI
response categories (1 = no, 5 = yes) were also modified. Both the original
question names and the new NHANES names can be found in the corresponding
codebook. NHANES CIDI modules can be distinguished by the pre-fix for the
variable names as follows:

CIQPAN: Generalized Panic Disorder  
CIQGAD: Generalized Anxiety Disorder  
CIQDEP: Major Depressive Disorders

## Analytic Notes

Special examination sample weights were developed for the half-sample that was
eligible for the interview. Because of small samples sizes, it is recommended
that the data from the 2-year files (1999-2000, 2001-2002, and 2003-2004) be
combined and that 6-year weights be used for all analyses. For an estimate for
the 6-years 1999-2004, a 6-year weight variable can be created by taking 2/3
of the 4 year weight for each sampled person in 1999-2002 and 1/3 of the 2
year weight for each sampled person in 2003-04. For more information on
weighting, please see the NHANES analytic guidelines.

Abbreviations frequently found in the codebooks and on variables labels:

WTA = worried, tense, or anxious  
SED = sad, empty, or depressed  
MDA = medication, drugs or alcohol

The NHANES CIDI questions were developed in accordance with the ICD-10 and
DSM-IV criteria for three diagnoses. As part of the final data preparation
effort, responses to the questions were evaluated using a computer algorithm,
first to assess each criterion, and then to combine criteria into diagnoses.
The diagnostic algorithms were constructed criterion by criterion, and all
criteria had to be met for a diagnosis to be positive. If all of the criteria
for a diagnosis were positive, the diagnosis was considered to be present for
the past 12 months. The algorithms, written in SAS code, are found in the CIDI
Appendices.

The "diagnostic score" variables are found at the end of each module. They are
named as follows: CIDPSCOR for Panic, CIDGSCOR for GAD, and CIDGSCOR for
Depression. A value of "1" indicates a positive diagnosis, and a value of "5"
indicates a negative diagnosis.

sample weights and other analytic issues at
