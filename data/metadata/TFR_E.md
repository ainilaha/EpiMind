# National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

## 2007-2008 Data Documentation, Codebook, and Frequencies

### Transferrin Receptor (TFR_E)

####  Data File: TFR_E.xpt

#####  First Published: September 2009

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are: 1) to provide data for monitoring
secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 2) to
evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity
and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's
nutritional status; and 3) to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and
public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food
fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status
of the U.S. population. These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and
toxicities of specific nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide
population reference data, and to estimate the contribution of diet,
supplements, and other factors to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used
for research to further define nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels
for disease prevention and health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 1-5 years, both genders, and females 12 to 49 years,who do
not meet any of the exclusion criteria, are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.  
  
Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (â30Â°C) conditions until they are shipped
to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The method for measurement of soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) is immuno-
turbidimetry using Roche kits on the Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer. Latex
bound anti-sTfR antibodies react with the antigen in the sample to form an
antigen/antibody complex. Following agglutination, this is measured
turbidimetrically.  
  
There were no changes (from the previous 2 years of NHANES) to equipment, lab
methods or lab site.

## Data Processing and Editing

Read the General Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed data
processing and editing protocols. The analytical methods are described in the
Analytic Notes for Data Users section below.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the General Documentation of Laboratory Data file for detailed
QA/QC protocols.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Household Questionnaire
Data Files contain demographic data, health indicators, and other related
information collected during household interviews. The Household Questionnaire
Data Files also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
required to analyze these data. The Phlebotomy Examination file includes
auxiliary information on duration of fasting, the time of day of the
venipuncture, and the conditions precluding venipuncture. The Household
Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be linked to the laboratory data
file using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.  
  
In cases, where the result was below the limit of detection, the value for
that variable is the detection limit divided by the square root of two.  
  
Exam sample weights should be used for analyses. Please refer to the Analytic
Guidelines for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic
issues. The Analytic Guidelines are available on the NHANES website.
