### Dietary Interview - Total Nutrient Intakes (DRXTOT_B)

####  Data File: DRXTOT_B.xpt

##### First Published: September 2004

##### Last Revised: July 2010

## Component Description

The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary
intake information from the NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are
used to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages consumed during
the 24-hour period prior to the interview (midnight to midnight), and to
estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food components from those
foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall, respondents are asked
questions on water consumption during the previous 24-hour period, salt use,
and whether the personâs intake on the previous day was usual or unusual.
Children 1 to 5 years old and women 16 to 49 years old are also asked about
their frequency of fish and shellfish consumption during the past 30 days.

This release of the dietary intake data represents, for the first time, the
integration of two nationwide dietary intake surveys - USDAâs Continuing
Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) and DHHSâs National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This new integrated dietary component
is collected as part of NHANES and is called **What We Eat in America**. Under
the integrated framework, DHHS is responsible for the sample design and data
collection and USDA is responsible for the surveyâs dietary data collection
methodology, maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data,
and data review and processing.

Survey integration of dietary data collection began in NHANES 2002. Because
NHANES is on a two-year data release cycle, this first release of the
integrated survey includes dietary data collected in 2001 from NHANES plus
data from the integrated survey collected in 2002. Collection and processing
procedures for the two years were similar. Differences between the two years,
along with steps taken to reconcile these differences, are discussed
throughout this document.

Data collection for the _What We Eat in America 2002_ also included a second
day recall that was collected by telephone. Because of confidentiality issues
concerning the release of single-year data from NHANES, dietary data for the
2002 Day 2 telephone interview will not be publicly released. Only Day 1
interview data are included in the present release.

Restricted data, such as the 2002 Day 2 dietary data, may be made available at
the Research Data Center located at the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) headquarters in Hyattsville, MD. A research proposal for using the
restricted data must be submitted to NCHS for review and approval.
Instructions for requesting use of these data are available at:
<https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/>

Two data files were produced from the Day 1 dietary interview for this
release:

  1. Total Nutrient Intakes File (DRXTOT_B) that consists of daily total nutrient intakes from foods and beverages, total amount of water consumed, and frequency of fish and shellfish consumption for survey participants. 
  2. Individual Foods File (DRXIFF_B) that includes detailed information about the type and amount of individual foods reported by each respondent, as well as amounts of nutrients from each food. 

Nutrient intakes reported in these files do not include those obtained from
dietary supplements, medications or plain drinking water.

This document provides additional details important to understanding the
content of the Total Nutrient Intakes File (DRXTOT_B). The Total Nutrient
Intakes File provides a summary record of total nutrient intakes for
individuals, as well as detailed information about the characteristics of the
dietary interview. This file includes one record for each survey participant.
Each record contains daily aggregates of nutrient intake in units appropriate
to the nutrient. A complete [list of
nutrients](http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=12762) contained in
USDA's  Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) is available at
the Food Surveys Research Group (FSRG) website
(<http://www.ars.usda.gov/ba/bhnrc/fsrg>).

Information about the individual foods reported by respondents during the
dietary interview is contained in a separate NHANES 2001-2002 dietary data
file titled Individual Foods File (DRXIFF_B).

## Eligible Sample

All NHANES examined survey participants are eligible for the dietary interview
component. However, several questions that follow the 24-hour recall are only
asked of a subset of survey participants. Frequency of fish and shellfish
consumption is only reported for children 1-5 years old and women 16-49 years
of age, and information on the use of table salt is only reported for
participants 1 year and older.

## Protocol and Procedure

The examination protocol and data collection methods are fully documented in
the NHANES Dietary Interviewers Procedures Manuals (In-person interview:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2001-2002/manuals/dietary_year_3.pdf>;
phone-follow-up interview:
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2001-2002/manuals/phone_followup_year_3.pdf>).

Proxy interviews were conducted for survey participants less than six years of
age. Assisted interviews were conducted with survey participants 6 to 11 years
of age. Dietary interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Translators
were used to conduct interviews in other languages.

The in-person interview was conducted in a private room in the NHANES mobile
examination center (MEC). A set of standard measuring guides was available in
the MEC dietary interview room for the respondent to use for reporting amounts
of foods.

In 2001, dietary intake data were collected using the NHANES computer-assisted
dietary interview system (CADI), which was also used to collect dietary data
for the 1999-2000 collection period. The CADI is a multiple pass recall method
which provides instructions to interviewers for recording information about
foods. Additional information about the CADI system is provided in the NHANES
1999-2000 Dietary Interviewers Procedures Manual
(<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/default.aspx?BeginYear=1999>)

In 2002, What We Eat in America data were collected using USDAâs dietary
data collection instrument, the Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM)
(<http://www.ars.usda.gov/ba/bhnrc/fsrg>). The AMPM was designed to provide a
more efficient and accurate means of collecting intakes for large-scale
national surveys. The AMPM is a fully computerized recall method that includes
an extensive compilation of standardized food-specific questions and possible
response options. It features automated routing of questions based on previous
answers. The AMPM is updated yearly to capture the changing food supply and to
address research needs from the data user community. Additional information
about the AMPM is provided in Raper et al (Raper et al., 2004).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

All dietary interviewers had to complete an intensive one-week training course
followed by supervised interview practices before working independently in the
field. Retraining sessions were conducted periodically and annually to
reinforce the proper protocols and technique.

Interviewers were monitored throughout the data collection period. Monitoring
consisted of the following:

  1. Reviews of data transmittal sheets to verify receipt of data files. 
  2. Reviews of audio taped interviews for approximately 5% of each interviewer's work; in-person observations were also conducted periodically. 
  3. Interviews were checked for completeness of the recalls, missing information, inconsistent reports, and unclear notes. Written notification and feedback were provided to the interviewers. 

In 2001, interviewers reviewed each interview after completion, performing
appropriate edits. Interviewers were not required to review interviews
collected in 2002 using the USDA's AMPM because quality control features are
built into the software. Incorrect entries are minimized due to automated
routing of questions and built-in edits.

## Data Processing and Editing

Two similar systems were used to code the intake data for 2001 and 2002. The
University of Texas Food Intake Analysis System (FIAS, version 3.99) was used
for coding intakes for 2001. For 2002, interview files were imported into
Survey Net, a computer-assisted food coding and data management system
developed by USDA (Raper et al., 2004). FIAS is a general-use version of the
Survey Net software that is available to researchers through the University of
Texas.

The USDA FNDDS, version 1, was used for processing the intakes for 2001-2002.
The FNDDS includes comprehensive information that can be used to code
individual foods and portion sizes and contains nutrient values for
calculating nutrient intakes. The FNDDS is available for use in research
projects using the 2001-2002 food intake data and in other food intake
studies, as well. Additional information (Raper et al., 2004; Bodner-Montville
et al, 2006) about the FNDDS and related tools is available at the FSRG
website.

Coders were monitored to ensure quality and completeness. Approximately 10
percent of the coderâs work was double-coded and adjudicated, if necessary.

After intake data were coded, various types of reviews were conducted to
ensure the quality of the data, including:

  * Overall acceptability of each recall. This review determined if the recall met minimum criteria.   
  
Minimum criteria for the 2001 data collection included the following:  

    1. Less than 25% of the foods with missing descriptive information. 
    2. Less than 15% of the foods with missing amounts. 
    3. Any meal reported must have at least one identified food. 
  
Minimum criteria for 2002 data collection included the following:  

    1. The first 4 steps of the 5-step AMPM were completed. Because the AMPM includes automated routing of questions, missing descriptive or amount information cannot occur. 
    2. Foods consumed for each reported meal must be identified. 
  * Interviewersâ and codersâ questions and comments were reviewed to ensure that they had been accounted for in coding. 
  * Resolution of unknown foods or food quantities that were reported by respondents but could not be coded to foods in the database. 
  * Specific edit checks for reasonableness, consistency, and logic. Examples are meals reported at unusual times and extremely large quantities of foods. 
  * Intakes with extreme levels for individual nutrients. 

An overview of quality assurance procedures conducted during the data
processing stage is available at the FSRG website (Anand et al., 2006).

During data processing, the following edits were made to ensure the logical
consistency and analytic usefulness of the data:

  1. **Adjusted sodium values for certain foods  
  
**Sodium values for home-prepared foods are based on the sodium values of
recipe ingredients in the FNDDS. The amount of salt in recipes was reduced, or
eliminated, in some cases based on questions about salt use in the dietary
interview.

  2. **Computing water consumption**   
  
The total nutrient intakes file includes three water variables: total plain
water (DRD320GW), tap water (DRD330GW), and plain carbonated water (DRDCWATR).
Total plain water includes tap water and non-carbonated bottled water. Plain
carbonated water includes unsweetened carbonated water, seltzer water, club
soda, and carbonated bottled water such as Perrier. Information on water
consumption was collected differently in 2001 and 2002. The following
adjustments were made in order to report the three variables:  
  

     * In 2001, consumption of total plain water and tap water were asked separately and these questions were used to create DRD320GW and DRD330GW, respectively. The variable, DRDCWATR, was created by summing all plain carbonated water that the respondent reported during the 24-hour recall that was not consumed in combination with another food (for example, juice and club soda). These records were then removed from the individual foods file. 
     * In 2002, consumption of tap, bottled, and plain carbonated water was asked separately. Total plain water (DRD320GW) was calculated as the sum of tap water and non-carbonated bottled water. 

## Analytic Notes

The [analytic
guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_general_guidelines_june_04.pdf)
provided with the 2001-2002 NHANES data release recommend combining 2-year
cycles, such as 1999-2000 and 2001-2002, to increase sample size and analytic
options. However, the guidelines also advise that the user should verify that
data items were collected and reported in a comparable manner in all combined
years. Thus, before combining the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 dietary data,
researchers should carefully consider the following information. Between these
two time periods, nutrient values for many foods were revised, based on
improvements in sampling and analyzing foods. Also, values for new nutrients
and food components became available, and units of expression for some
existing nutrients were changed. NHANES 2001-2002 nutrient intakes were
calculated using USDAâs FNDDS version 1.0, which contains the most up-to-
date food composition values available for this time frame. NHANES 1999-2000
nutrient intakes were calculated using an earlier version of the database, the
USDA 1994-1998 Survey Nutrient Database. Thus, analyzing merged intake data
for these two data sets should be carefully considered for each nutrient.
Analyses conducted based on changes in the nutrient databases show that the
impact can be significant depending on the nutrient (Anderson et al., 2001;
Ahuja et al., 2006).

A status code (DRDDRSTZ) is used in the NHANES 2001-2002 dietary interview
component to indicate the quality and completeness of the response to the
dietary recall section. The dietary recall section status is coded as one of
the following:

  1. Reliable and met the minimum criteria
  2. Not reliable or not met the minimum criteria   
No data on total nutrient intake or individual food consumption is provided
for these cases.

  3. Reported consuming breast-milk  
Human milk was reported in some dietary recalls. Few respondents could
quantify the human milk intake for their breast-fed infants/children. For
those cases, no total nutrient intakes were derived. The foods consumed by
nursing infants and children are reported in the Individual Foods File.

  4. Not Done.  
The dietary recall section of the interview did not take place due to various
reasons (such as came late/left early, refusal, illness, emergency, or
equipment failure).

In addition to the status code described above, the variable DRD300 indicates
the nature of the reported dietary recall information from a different
perspective. It denotes the respondentâs assessment of the overall intake
for the recall day as to whether the amount of food consumed was a usual
amount, much more than usual, or much less than usual.

In 2002, the respondent was asked the question âAre you currently on any
kind of diet, either to lose weight or for some other health-related
reason?â Because this question was not asked in 2001, the responses will not
be publicly released but may be accessible through the NCHS Research Data
Center. Instructions for requesting use of these data at the NCHS Data
Research Center are available at <https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/>.

**Sample weights for dietary intake data:** The NHANES participants were
selected on the basis of a national probability design. In order to increase
the number of participants for specific demographic groups, a multi-stage,
unequal probability of selection design was implemented. The NHANES
oversamples blacks, Mexican Americans, low income whites, adolescents 12-19
years, and persons 60 years and older. Sample weights are constructed that
encompass the unequal probabilities of selection, as well as adjustments for
non-participation by selected sample persons. In order to produce national,
representative estimates, the appropriate sample weights must be used.

For the 2001-2002 NHANES, there were 13,156 persons selected; of these 10,477
were considered respondents to the MEC examination and data collection.
However, only 9,883 of the MEC respondents provided complete dietary intakes.

Most analyses of NHANES data use data collected in the MEC and the variable
WTMEC2YR should be used for the sample weights. However, for the dietary data,
different sample weights are recommended for analysis. Although attempts are
made to schedule MEC exams uniformly throughout the week, proportionally more
exams occur on weekend days than on weekdays. Because food intake can vary by
day of week, use of the MEC weights would disproportionately represent intakes
on weekends.

A set of weights WTDRD1 is provided that should be used when an analysis uses
the NHANES 2001-2002 dietary recall data (either alone or when nutrient data
are used in conjunction with MEC data). The set of weights WTDRD1 is
applicable to the 9,883 respondents with dietary data. The weights WTDRD1 were
constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and further adjusting
for (a) the additional non-response and (b) the differential allocation by day
of the week for the dietary intake data collection. These weights are more
variable than the MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated
standard errors using dietary data and dietary weights are larger than
standard errors for similar estimates based on MEC weights. In addition, a set
of four-year dietary weight (WTDR4YR) is also provided that should be used for
the combined analyses of NHANES 1999-2000 and NHANES 2001-2002 data.

Note that all sample weights are person-level weights and each set of weights
should add to the same population control total as the MEC weights (WTMEC2YR).
In addition, the MEC weights (WTMEC2YR) are appropriate for use in the
analysis of the fish and shellfish consumption data (i.e., variables DRD340,
DRD350A-K, DRD350AQ-JQ, DRD360, DRD370A-V, and DRD370AQ-UQ) and the use of
table salt data (i.e., variables DBQ095 and DBD100) located in the Total
Nutrient Intake File (DRXTOT_B), if no other dietary data are included in the
analysis. Additional explanation of sample weights and appropriate uses are
included in the **[NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx)** Â
(<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx>). Please also
refer to the on-line **[NHANES
Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/nhanes/)** Â
(<https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/>) for further details on other analytic
issues.
