## Component Description

**C-reactive protein**

C-reactive protein is considered one of the best measures of the acute phase
response to an infectious disease or other cause of tissue damage and
inflammation. It is used to correct the iron status measures, which are
affected by inflammation. It can also be used to measure the body's response
to inflammation from chronic conditions, such as arthritis, and environmental
exposures to agents such as tobacco smoke.

**Fibrinogen**

Fibrinogen is an essential blood-clotting factor and is involved in a range of
other functions, including platelet aggregation and smooth muscle
proliferation. A growing body of evidence has identified fibrinogen as an
important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the major cause of death in
the U.S. The objective of including this measure is to provide data on
laboratory, clinical, and socio- demographic correlates of fibrinogen levels.
Of particular importance in NHANES, the data will be used to study the
relationship between fibrinogen levels and clinically measured lower extremity
arterial blood flow as assessed by the Ankle-Brachial Index in the Lower
Extremity Disease component.

**Helicobacter pylori**

This organism has been shown to be the causative agent in chronic-active  
gastritis, and evidence has almost completely satisfied Koch's postulates for
this organisms' pathogenicity in primary duodenal ulcers. More recent evidence
has suggested that chronic H. pylori infection as well as early age of H.
pylori- acquisition is a critical precursor to gastric carcinoma. Although an
explosion of research has occurred over the past decade, many fundamental
questions on the route of transmission and the role of environmental risk
factors (i.e. food, water) remain to be answered. Because NHANES will have
numerous data on environmental exposures in addition to demographic data on
participants, these data can be analyzed to add information on potential route
of transmission for this organism.

**Bone alkaline phosphatase and Ntx**

To assist in the evaluation of skeletal status, two markers of bone turnover
are being measured: a) bone alkaline phosphatase, a formative marker in serum,
and b) NTX, a resorptive marker in urine.

## Eligible Sample

**Eligible Sample**

C-reactive protein (CRP) and Helicobacter pylori: Participants aged 3 years
and older

Fibrinogen: Participants aged 40 years and older

Bone alkaline phosphatase and Ntx: Participants aged 8 years and older

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Data Collection Methods**

Blood and urine specimens are processed, stored and shipped to the University  
of Washington for analysis.

**Examination Protocol**

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials were
stored under appropriate frozen (-20 degrees Centigrade) conditions until they
were shipped to University of Washington for testing. The analytical methods
are described in the Analytic methodology section.

**Analytic Methodology**

**C-reactive protein**

This method quantifies C-reactive protein (CRP) by latex-enhanced  
nephelometry. Particle-enhanced assays are based on the reaction between a
soluble analyte and the corresponding antigen or antibody bound to polystyrene
particles. For the quantification of CRP, particles consisting of a
polystyrene core and a hydrophilic shell are used in order to link anti-CRP
antibodies covalently.  
A dilute solution of test sample is mixed with latex particles coated with
mouse monoclonal anti-CRP antibodies. CRP present in the test sample will form
an antigen-antibody complex with the latex particles.

An automatic blank subtraction is performed. CRP concentrations are calculated  
by using a calibration curve. Data reduction of the signals is performed by
using  
a storable logit-log function for the calibration curve. These assays are
performed on a Behring Nephelometer for quantitative CRP determination.

**Fibrinogen**

On the STA-Compact, the fibrinogen concentration in plasma is determined
quantitatively by the Clauss clotting method. This test method involves  
measuring the rate of fibrinogen to fibrin conversion in diluted sample under
the influence of excess thrombin. Since under these conditions the fibrinogen  
content is rate limiting, the clotting time can be used as a measure of the
concentration of the fibrinogen and in fact, the clotting time is inversely
proportional to the level of fibrinogen in the plasma.

Clot detection by the STA-Compact involves an electromagnetic- mechanical  
system. The oscillation of a steel ball within the cuvette with the thrombin
and diluted plasma is monitored by the STA-Compact. When the oscillation of
the steel ball is stopped by clot formation, the sensor registers the time in
seconds. The time is translated into fibrinogen concentration from a
fibrinogen standard curve, stored on the STA Compact.

**Helicobacter pylori**

The Wampole Laboratories (Wampole) H. pylori IgG Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assays (ELISA) is intended for the detection and qualitative determination of
IgG antibodies to Helicobacter pylori in human serum.

Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) rely on the ability of biological
materials, (i.e. antigens) to adsorb to plastic surfaces such as polystyrene
(solid phase). When antigens bound to the solid phase are brought into contact
with a participant's serum, antigen-specific antibody, if present, will bind
to the antigen on the solid phase forming antigen-antibody complexes. Excess
antibody is removed by washing. This is followed by the addition of goat anti-
human IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, which then binds to the
antibody-antigen complexes. The excess conjugate is removed by washing,
followed by the addition of chromogen substrate tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). If
specific antibody to the antigen is present in the participant's serum, a blue
color develops. When the enzymatic reaction is stopped with 1N H2SO4, the
contentsof the wells turn yellow. The color, which is proportional to the
concentration of antibody in the serum, can be read on a suitable
spectrophotometer or ELISA microwell plate reader. The sensitivity,
specificity, and reproducibility of enzyme- linked immunoassays can be
comparable to other serological tests for antibody, such as
immunofluorescence, complement fixation, hemagglutination, and
radioimmunoassays.

**Bone alkaline phosphatase**

The Tandem-MP Ostase ImmunoEnzymetric Assay is an in vitro device for the
quantitative measurement of Skeletal Alkaline Phosphatase (sALP), an indicator  
of osteoblastic activity, in human serum. This device is intended to be used
as  
an aid in the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis and Paget's disease.  
The Ostase Assay is a solid phase, monoclonal antibody immnumoenzymetric
assay. Samples containing sALP are reacted with a solution containing a
biotin- labeled, sALP-specific monoclonal antibody. The reaction takes place
in a plastic well strip (solid phase) coated with strepavidin and enclosed in
a plastic frame. Following the formation of a solid phase/capture
antibody/sALP complex, the microplate is washed to remove  
unbound sALP and is then incubated with an enzyme substrate. The amount of
substrate turnover is determined colorimetrically by measuring the absorbance
of the quenched reaction at 405 nm in a microplate reader. The absorbance is
proportional to the concentration of sALP present in the test sample. The
calculation of sALP concentration in the sample is based on concurrent testing
of sALP Calibrators and theZero Diluent/Calibrator.

The Ostase assay is an in vitro device for the quantitative measurement of
skeletal alkaline phosphatase (sALP) in human serum. Changes in sALP have been
shown to be useful in participants undergoing therapy for metabolic bone
disorders. It may also be an indicator of vitamin D deficiency in some  
participants.

**Ntx (N-teleopeptides)**

Osteomark is a competitive inhibition enzyme linked solid-phase immunosorbent
assay for the quantitative measurement of the cross-linked N-telopeptides of
type  
I bone collagen (NTx) in human urine. The solid phase consists of microwells
onto which cross-linked telopeptides (antigen) is adsorbed. Urine controls,
test samples and calibrators are added to the antigen coated 96 well plate.
Antibody to the N-telopeptide cross-links that are conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase is then added to each well. During an initial incubation period,
antigen in the sample competes with the solid phase antigen for binding to the
antibody. The wells are then washed to remove unbound material.

Buffered substrate/chromogen reagent is then added to each well. During the
final incubation, a blue color will develop when bound antibody-horseradish
peroxidase conjugate is present in the well. The color intensity is a measure
of the amount of conjugated antibody bound to the solid phase antigen, and is
inversely proportional to the amount of antigen in the test sample. The
reaction is stopped by the addition of stopping reagent (1N sulfuric acid)
which results in a color change from blue to yellow. The absorbance values for
the control, calibrators and test samples are determined
spectrophotometrically at 450 nm with a 650 nm reference filter, by using a
microtiter plate reader.

A standard curve is constructed for each assay by plotting absorbance versus
concentration for each calibrator. The antigen concentrations of the samples
and control are then read from the curve. Assay values are standardized to an
equivalent amount of bone collagen, and are expressed in nanomoles bone
collagen equivalents (nM BCE/L) per liter. Often assay results are corrected
for urinary dilution by urinary creatinine analysis and expressed in nanomoles
bone collagen equivalents per liter (nM BCE/L) per millimole creatinine per
liter (mM creatinine/L). This ratio is reported as nM BCE/mM creatinine.

The discovery of urinary cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTx)
has provided a specific biochemical marker of human bone resorption. The NTx
molecule is specific to bone due to the unique amino acid sequences and
orientation of the cross-linked alpha-2 N-telopeptide. Generation of the NTx
molecule is mediated by osteoclasts on bone, and is found in the urine as a
stable end product of degradation.

## Analytic Notes

**LBXBAP and URXNT**

In 1999-2000 these tests were performed on males 8 years and older and  
females 18 years and older. Beginning in 2000 these tests are performed on all
examinees 8 years and older.

**LBXHP1**

A value <0.90 is considered negative for the presence of detectable IgG
antibody. Values between 0.91-1.09 are considered equivocal and values greater
than 1.10 indicates the presence of detectable IgG antibody.

**Use of regression equation to trend 1999-2000 Bone Alkaline Phosphatase
(BAP) data with 2001-2004 BAP data:**

Adjustment of Bone Alkaline Phosphatase was necessary for NHANES 2001 data
because of a change of laboratory methods between 2001 (using a Hybritech
method) and 2002 (using a Beckman Access method) The distributions of sample
person results were compared between NHANES 2001 and NHANES 2002 and the BAP
test had significantly (p < 0.05) different means. A cross-over study between
the two methods was performed to establish regression equations to convert
NHANES 2001 values to NHANES 2002 values. The regression equations were
applied to the BAP test, and a t test was done after regression that showed no
significant differences of BAP test means between the two methods after
regression. The regression equations were derived from a spline technique
using logarithm-transformed BAP values. The following regression equation was
obtained:

x = log(lbxbap)  
lbdbap = exp(-0.5326 + 1.1139*x - 0.7963*(max(0, x-4.5151)) + 0.9660*(max(0,
x-4.9030)))

where lbxbap is the BAP (ug/L) value from the 1999-2001 Hybritech method and
lbdbap is the BAP (ug/L) equivalent value for the 2002-2004 Beckman Access
method. The analyst may wish to use this equation to trend the 1999-2004 BAP
data.
