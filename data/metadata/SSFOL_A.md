### Folic Acid - Unmetabolized (Surplus) (SSFOL_A)

####  Data File: SSFOL_A.xpt

##### First Published: October 2009

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at

## Component Description

Measurement of unmetabolized folic acid from stored sera specimens from NHANES
1999-2000 in participants >= 60 years of age.

## Eligible Sample

Participants >= 60 years of age from NHANES 1999-2000 with stored sera.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Measurement of Unmetabolized Folic Acid in Serum**. Folic acid and 5MeTHF
concentrations were determined using the affinity/HPLC method with
electrochemical (coulometric) detection method Which was developed by us at
the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts University (BagleyÂ et al.,Â
1997; Kalmbach et al., 2008) with the following modifications to increase
throughput and precision.Â Serum samples (0.2 mL) were diluted with 1.2 mL of
50mM potassium tetraborate in 1% sodium ascorbate and vortexed. Twenty
picomoles of ethyltetrahydrofolate (eTHF) was added as an internal standard.
The mixture was boiled for 30 minutes and then cooled on ice and kept covered
overnight at 4Â° C. The mixture was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4Â° C at
36,000xg and filtered. An aliquot (0.9ml) of the supernatant fraction was
injected onto the affinity/HPLC system. The revised affinity/HPLC system
consisted of two affinity columns, containing immobilized folate binding
protein (FBP), that were connected via a 10 port, two position switching valve
to an analytical column (Betasil Phenyl 250 x 4.6 mm; Keystone Scientific).
This allows one affinity column to be loaded with the sample and subsequently
washed with a pH 7.0 phosphate buffer, while the second is eluted into the
analytical column with an acetonitrile gradient at acid pH and into the
electrochemical detector. At the end of the run, a signal is sent to switch
the direction of the mobile phases to allow the elution of the loaded column
for folate analysis and simultaneous loading of the second column with the new
sample. Folate activity was determined by using an ESA Four Channel Coularray
Detector set at 0, 300, 500 and 600mV. Quantification and identification of
individual folates was done by comparison to external and internal folate
standards of known concentration. Limit of detection was 0.18 pmol/ml for
5-methyltetrahydrofolate and folic acid. Recovery was 92.2%
(5-methyltetrahydrofolate) and 98.9% (folic acid). CVâs for samples ran
alone or spiked with 5, 10, and 20 pmol of folate were 5.2-8.6% for
5-methyltetrahydrofolate (within day) and 3.2-6.3 (between days) and for folic
acid 5.3-6.4% (within day) and 3.5-7.3 (between days). Run time for the HPLC
was reduced to 30 min per sample (40-45 samples analyzed per 24 hours).

Total folate determined by this method highly correlated (r2=0.93, p< 0.001)
with values obtained by the microbial assay

## Data Processing and Editing

Data was received after all the laboratory testing was complete. The data were
not edited.  
Data Access: All data are publicly available.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring
