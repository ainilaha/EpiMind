### Polyfluoroalkyl Chemicals (PFC_F)

####  Data File: PFC_F.xpt

#####  First Published: December 2011

#####  Last Revised: October 2013

## Component Description

Organic fluorochemicals are used in multiple commercial applications including
surfactants, lubricants, paints, polishes, food packaging and fire-retarding
foams. Several of these polyfluorochemicals (PFCs) are ubiquitous contaminants
found both in humans and animals worldwide. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)
has been used in a wide variety of industrial and consumer products including
protective coatings for carpets and apparel, paper coatings, insecticide
formulations, and surfactants. In May 2000, the 3M Company, the sole
manufacturer of PFOS in the United States and the principal manufacturer
worldwide, announced that it was discontinuing the production of
perfluorooctanyl fluoride-based chemistries, including PFOS. Perfluorooctanoic
acid (PFOA) is used primarily to produce its salts which are used in the
production of fluoroelastomers and fluoropolymers, such as
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF). PTFE has
numerous uses in many industrial and consumer products, including coatings on
textiles and carpet; uses in the automotive, mechanical, aerospace, chemical,
electrical, medical, and building/construction industries; personal care
products; and non-stick coatings on cookware. PVDF is used primarily in
electrical/electronics, building/construction, and chemical processing
industrial sectors.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 12 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Solid phase extraction coupled to High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Turbo
Ion Spray ionization-tandem Mass Spectrometry (online SPE-HPLC-TIS-MS/MS) is
used for the quantitative detection of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA),
2-(N-methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH),
2-(N-ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid (Et-PFOSA-AcOH),
perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBuS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS),
perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluoroheptanoate (PFHpA),
perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), perfluorononanoate (PFNA), perfluorodecanoate
(PFDeA), perfluoroundecanoate (PFUA), and perfluorododecanoate (PFDoA)
(Kuklenyik Z, et al. 2005). Briefly, after dilution with formic acid, one
aliquot of 100 μL of serum is injected into a commercial column switching
system allowing for concentration and chromatographic separation of the
analytes. Detection and quantification are done using tandem mass spectrometry
(Kuklenyik Z, et al. 2005).

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Serum specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard (1981)) (Caudil SP, et al.
2008).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Serum polyfluorinated chemicals were measured in a one third subsample of
persons 12 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze
these data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included
in this data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES Demographic Data File
contains demographic and sample design variables. The recommended procedure
for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU variables (SDMVSTRA
and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named
LBD___LC indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There
are two values: "0" and "1"". "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection.

The other variable named LBX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte.

The constant lower limits of detection for each polyfluorochemical is:

Analyte | Item Id | LLOD  
---|---|---  
Perfluorooctanoic acid | LBXPFOA | 0.1  
Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid | LBXPFOS | 0.2  
Perfluorohexane sulfonic acid | LBXPFHS | 0.1  
2-(N-Ethyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid | LBXEPAH | 0.1  
2-(N-Methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamido) acetic acid | LBXMPAH | 0.1  
Pefluorodecanoic acid | LBXPFDE | 0.1

Perfluorooctane sulfonamide | LBXPFSA | 0.1  
Perfluoroundecanoic acid | LBXPFUA | 0.1  
Perflurododecanoic acid | LBXPFDO | 0.1  
  
Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
