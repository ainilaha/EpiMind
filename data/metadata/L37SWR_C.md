### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA - Vaginal Swab: Roche Linear Array
(L37SWR_C)

####  Data File: L37SWR_C.xpt

##### First Published: November 2010

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexually
transmitted infections in the United States. Cervical infection with certain
types of HPV is a major risk factor for cervical cancer in women. The "high-
risk" types of HPV (e.g., HPV 16, 18) are associated with cervical cancer and
the "low-risk" types (e.g., HPV 6, 11) with genital warts. No national
surveillance system exists to measure the full burden of HPV infection, and no
reliable national population estimate of HPV exists. NHANES offers a unique
opportunity to assess the prevalence of HPV infection in the general
population.

Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Healthy People 2010 objective:
"Reducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the overall number of
cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer in females..."
Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs (in conjunction with testing
of NHANES sera for HPV antibody) will allow evaluation of trends in prevalence
of type-specific HPV infection by age, sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity.
Two HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use
in girls and women. Routine vaccination is recommended for girls 11 or 12
years of age, and catch-up vaccination through 26 years. One vaccine
(Gardasil) is licensed and available for boys and men. As vaccine becomes more
widely used, the national prevalence of HPV infection will be critical for
planning vaccination strategies in the United States.

Results of the Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test and HPV typing based on the Roche
prototype line blot assay have been previously released. The current data
release adds HPV typing results based on the Roche research use only Linear
Array (LA) HPV Genotyping kit. The LA typing assay is based upon the same
assay principles as the prototype, but includes proprietary refinements to
improve sensitivity and reproducibility.

## Eligible Sample

Examined female participants aged 14-59 years were eligible. This public data
file includes data for examined participants aged 18-59 years. Please see
Analytic Notes about the release of data for adolescents aged 14-17 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Roche Linear Array Assay  
**  
This assay uses the Research Use Only (RUO) Roche Linear Array HPV Genotyping
test that is based on HPV L1 consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
biotinylated PGMY09/11 primer sets. It also includes biotinylated β-globin
primers as an internal control for sample amplification. The primer mix
amplifies essentially all HPV types found in the genital tract along with the
human β-globin gene. After amplification the samples are typed by
hybridization to the typing strips followed by colorimetric detection. The
strip is a linear array of probes specific for 37 HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18,
26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64,
66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, IS39, and 89) and for the
positive β-globin control as well. Types are read by comparing the reaction
pattern to the typing template. Samples that are negative for HPV and the
β-globin control indicate lack of a suitable sample and are considered
inadequate for interpretation.

[HPV Vaginal Swab Linear Array Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2003-2004/labmethods/l37_c_met_dna_extraction_swab.pdf)
(November 2010)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Vaginal swab samples were processed, stored and shipped to the Chronic Viral
Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology,
National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2003-2004/manuals/lab.pdf). Swabs
were stored at room temperature until they were shipped to the National Center
for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases for testing.

Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2003-2004/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2003-2004 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2003)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Sample Weights**

MEC exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2003-2004 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2003-2004/DEMO_C.XPT) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data, health indicators,
and other related information collected during household interviews. Certain
sensitive data on participants under 18 years of age (e.g., HPV typing
results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files.
These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines.

The public release data file includes HPV vaginal swab data for participants
aged 18-59. HPV vaginal swab data for youth aged 14-17 years are available
through the [NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

HPV DNA detection and typing results from two assays are provided: the Roche
prototype line blot assay (previously released, Data set name: l37SWA_C) and
the Roche research use only Linear Array (LA) HPV Genotyping kit (Data set
name: l37SWR_C). The Roche prototype reagents were discontinued when the LA
assay was released and will not be available for further use in future NHANES
cycles. While based on identical principles, the LA was refined for
commercialization as a research use only kit. The two assays were comparable,
although LA was found to be more sensitive and detected more types per sample
(3, 4, 5). To assure comparability of results in the ongoing NHANES sampling,
residual extracts from 2003-2004 were retested with LA.

• **We recommend all analysis of HPV DNA PCR be conducted using the Roche LA
results (Data set name: L37SWR_C) in order to provide the most accurate
longitudinal information on HPV detection and typing by PCR.**

Note: The two data sets can also be distinguished by the variable names. The
data for the Roche prototype line blot assay has a fourth letter of the
variable name, H. The Roche LA assay has the fourth letter of the variable
name, R.

**HPV PCR Assay**

**HPV Summary Variable**

The HPV PCR Summary variable (LBDRPCR) indicates if at least one type is
positive (LBDRPCR=1), the sample is negative (LBDRPCR=2), the sample is
inadequate (LBDRPCR=3), or the sample is missing (LBDRPCR=.).

If beta-globin is not present, both LBDRHP and LBDRLP are negative in the
sample and no HPV type is detected, the sample is coded as "Inadequate".

If any of the types on the strips (LBDR06-LBDRPI) are positive, the sample is
coded as positive. If all of the types on the strip are coded as negative, and
beta-globin is detected (either LBDRHP or LBDRLP is positive) the sample is
coded as negative.

Variables LBDRHP through LBDRPI are from the RUO Roche Linear Array HPV typing
assay, however LBDR52 also includes information from a type-specific assay for
HPV 52. The Linear Array typing strip includes an XR probe that hybridizes
with HPV 52 as well as HPV types 33, 35 and 58. Samples positive for the XR
probe and 33, 35 or 58 requires specific testing to confirm the presence of
HPV 52.

**Detection Limits**

If data is qualitative, the use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
