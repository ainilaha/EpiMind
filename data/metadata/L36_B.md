## Component Description

Although there has been a marked decrease in the number of primary and
secondary syphilis cases in the United States, there has been very little
decrease in the number of reported cases of late latent and tertiary syphilis
over the past 20 years. This suggests that there may be a large pool of
infected but asymptomatic persons. Although the primary and secondary stages
of syphilis are infectious and associated with fetal wastage and the
congenital syphilis syndrome, the tertiary stage is associated with a
vasculitis that may cause neurologic and cardiovascular manifestations and
other chronic problems. Similarly, primary and secondary syphilis increase the
risk of HIV acquisition and transmission while latent disease may be
associated with progression of HIV disease to AIDS and more prominent
neurologic disease in HIV-infected persons. Despite the importance of syphilis
as a risk factor for both chronic disease and the progression of HIV
infection, there has not been a population-based measure of syphilis
prevalence for the United States since 1980. Because these are often
asymptomatic stages of infection and may lead to severe neurologic or
cardiovascular complications, it is important to document a decrease in the
late stages of syphilis that have resulted from our extraordinary efforts to
reduce primary and secondary syphilis. NHANES offers a unique opportunity to
estimate the prevalence of reactive serologic tests as an estimate of the
prevalence of syphilis infections in the general population, to identify and
confirm risk factors for syphilis, to confirm the risk for HIV infection and
HIV-related neurologic disease among Americans with syphilis, and to monitor
trends in prevalence as syphilis detection and treatment programs are
established and expanded.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 18 to 49 years were tested.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Syphilis-G enzyme immunoassay (EIA)**

The Captia Syphilis-G enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is an indirect method for the
detection of IgG antibodies to _Treponema pallidum_(Pope et al., 1998; Lefevre
et al., 1990; Nayar et al., 1993; Silletti et al., 1995; Young et al., 1995).
Currently, CDC recommends that the test be used in the clinical laboratory as
a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of syphilis. However, the test may be
used as a screening test and is FDA approved for such use in clinical
laboratories and blood banks. _T. pallidum_ antigens are coated onto the wells
of a 96-well microtiter plate. A dilution of the patientâs serum is added to
the well to allow any _T. pallidum_ specific antibodies present to bind to the
treponemal antigens. Biotinylated anti-human IgG labeled with strepavidin-
peroxidase is used to detect the patientâs antibody. After rinsing off the
excess antibodies, an enzyme substrate is added for detection. If the patient
has antibodies to _T. pallidum_ , a color reaction takes place. The intensity
of the color development is proportional to the amount of antibody present.
This color change can then be read using a plate reader, which eliminates
subjective interpretation of the results.

**Rapid plasma reagin (RPR)**

The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) 18-mm circle card test is a macroscopic,
nontreponemal flocculation card test used to screen for syphilis (Portnoy et
al., 1962; Portnoy et al., 1963; Portnoy et al., 1965; Hynson Westcott and
Dunning et al., 1977). The antigen is prepared from a modified Venereal
Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) antigen suspension containing choline
chloride to eliminate the need to heat inactivate serum, ethylene-diamine-
tetra- acetic acid (EDTA) to enhance the stability of the suspension, and
finely divided charcoal particles as a visualizing agent. In the test, the RPR
antigen is mixed with unheated or heated serum or with unheated plasma on a
plastic-coated card. The RPR test measures IgM and IgG antibodies to lipoidal
material released from damaged host cells as well as to lipoprotein-like
material, and possibly cardiolipin released from the treponemes (Matthews et
al., 1979; Belisle et al., 1994). The anti lipoidal antibodies are antibodies
that are produced not only as a consequence of syphilis and other treponemal
diseases, but also in response to nontreponemal diseases of an acute and
chronic nature in which tissue damage occurs (Catterall et al., 1972). If
antibodies are present, they combine with the lipid particles of the antigen,
causing them to agglutinate. The charcoal particles coagglutinate with the
antibodies and show up as black clumps against the white card. If antibodies
are not present, the test mixture is uniformly gray. The test can be purchased
in kit form or in component parts from many commercial sources. Without some
other evidence for the diagnosis of syphilis, a reactive nontreponemal test
does not confirm _T. pallidum_ infection.

**_Treponema pallidum_ particle agglutination (TP-PA)**

The Serodia _Treponema pallidum_ particle agglutination (TP-PA) test is a
treponemal test for the serologic detection of antibodies to the various
species and subspecies of pathogenic Treponema, the causative agents of
syphilis, yaws, pinta, bejel, and endemic syphilis. The test is a passive
agglutination procedure based on the agglutination of gel particles sensitized
with _T. pallidum_ antigens by antibodies found in the patient's serumm
(Deguchi et al., 1994; Pope et al., 2000; Pope et al., 2000). The test is
intended as a confirmatory test to replace the microhemagglutination assay for
antibodies to _T. pallidum_ (MHA-TP).

Serum containing antibodies to pathogenic treponemes react with gel particles
sensitized with sonicated _T. pallidum_ , Nichols strain (the antigen), to
form a smooth mat of agglutinated gel particles in the microtiter tray well.
If antibodies are not present, the particles settle to the bottom of the tray
well, forming a characteristic compact button of unagglutinated particles. The
unsensitized gel particle control well for each serum should also show this
compact button, or the absence of agglutination.

The TP-PA test is used to confirm the reactive results (Pope et al., 2000;
Pope et al., 2000) of a nontreponemal screening test for syphilis, such as the
Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test, or as a diagnostic
test in patients with a nonreactive nontreponemal test but with signs or
symptoms suggestive of late syphilis.

**Testing algorithm for NHANES specimens**

All serum specimens were tested for IgG antibody by the EIA assay. If results
of this assay were positive or equivocal, the specimens were tested using the
RPR test. If the RPR test was negative, the TP-PA test was performed on the
sample.

**Suggested interpretation of laboratory results.**

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality control and quality assurance protocols (QA/QC) meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed quality control
and quality assurance instructions are discussed in the NHANES
Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file
for detailed QA/QC protocols.

## Data Processing and Editing

Serum specimens were processed, stored and shipped to Division of STD
Prevention Laboratory, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and
TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.
Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the
LABDOC file for detailed data processing and editing protocols. The analytical
methods are described in the Description of the Laboratory Methodology
section.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2001-2002 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2001-2002
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. They also contain all survey design variables and sample weights
for these age groups. The phlebotomy file includes auxiliary information such
as the conditions precluding venipuncture. The household questionnaire and
phlebotomy files may be linked to the laboratory data file using the unique
survey participant identifier SEQN.
