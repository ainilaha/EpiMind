### Acculturation (ACQ)

####  Data File: ACQ.xpt

#####  First Published: June 2002

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The Acculturation section (prefix ACQ) provides personal interview data on
cultural identity and language/media exposure.

## Eligible Sample

  
Non-Hispanics ages 12 and older are asked only one question in this section:
language spoken at home (ACQ010).

Hispanics ages 12 and older are asked questions ACQ020 - ACQ080. These
questions are about language use and country of birth of parents.

## Analytic Notes

ACQ010 (language spoken at home) had too few responses in the categories
"other than English or Spanish." The recoded data is in variables ACD010A,
ACD010B, and ACD010C.

ACQ040 (What language(s) do you usually speak at home? Would you say …) is
recoded to ACD040.

ACQ070 and ACQ080 (Country of Birth of father and mother, respectively) are
recoded in ACD070 AND ACD080.
