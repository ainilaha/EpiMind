### Dermatology (DEQ)

####  Data File: DEQ.xpt

##### First Published: June 2002

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Ã‚ The Dermatology section (variable name prefix DEQ) provides personal
interview data on several skin condition topics. Dermatology conditions have
not been evaluated in NHANES since NHANES I, 1971-75.

Many of the questions in this section were adapted from existing
questionnaires or scales used in clinical dermatology practice.

Topics in the DEQ section:

  * General questions about skin and hair 
  * Questions about history of skin disease 
  * Questions about current skin condition

## Eligible Sample

The eligible sample consists of participants age 6 through 59 years.

## Data Processing and Editing

Open-ended questions, such as DEQ.100 allow for multiple responses. Open-ended
questions were followed by the probes "any others" or "other specify" in order
to capture all possible responses.

Question DEQ.110 was checked along with age information (age <16 and age >\+  
16) to make sure that only people who were old enough to be in the work force
answered the question.



## Analytic Notes

**Special Notes on Using the Dataset**

Analysts should be aware that some questions, (e.g., DEQ.080 and DEQ.100) have
very few responses. Even with two years of data collection, there is not
enough sample size to allow for meaningful information to be derived from
these variables. Accordingly, these questions will be removed from the
questionnaire section as of 2002.
