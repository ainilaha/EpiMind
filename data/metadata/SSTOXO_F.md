### Toxoplasma Gondii Antibody - Serum (Surplus) (SSTOXO_F)

####  Data File: SSTOXO_F.xpt

##### First Published: August 2013

##### Last Revised: April 2022

##### Note: The NHANES Biospecimen Program processes were reevaluated in 2021
and 2022 to monitor quality control after a procedural error was identified.
This error did not pose any risk of participant disclosure. Addressing this
error resulted in the removal of some records from various stored biospecimen
data files between 1999 and 2018 that did not meet program standards. After a
comprehensive review of all stored specimen datasets, this data file was
modified to remove records (5-<10% of records) that were initially included in
error. No data values were altered. The sample weights and overall estimates
were compared between the original and revised files. The sample weights
provided with the original data release are appropriate to use with this
updated data file; therefore, no new survey weights were created. The overall
estimates from these files were examined and are consistent with the previous
file. However, not all possible analyses were performed. For any queries
related to this dataset please email the Biospecimen Program at
serumplasmaurine@cdc.gov.

## Component Description

All available sera from residual specimens from NHANES 2009-2010 participants
were tested for _Toxoplasma gondii_ by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that
detects IgG antibodies against _T. gondii._ All results in this data release
are reported as IU/ml. Samples with results ≥ 33 IU/mL should be coded as
Positive, samples with results < 27 IU/mL should be coded as Negative, and
samples with results ≥ 27 IU/mL and <33 IU/mL were considered Equivocal. All
results originally considered Equivocal were repeated at least twice for
confirmation and should be coded as Negative.

## Eligible Sample

All specimens from 2009-2010 leftover from laboratories who tested them and
sent the residual serum back to NCHS repository.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

 _Toxoplasma gondii_ antibodies were measured with a highly sensitive and
specific Toxoplasma IgG enzyme immunoassay kit (Bio-Rad, Redmond, VA). This
test utilizes antigen-coated wells. The samples are incubated in the antigen-
coated wells, (if present) _T. gondii_ antibodies are immobilized in the
wells. Residual sample is eliminated by washing and conjugate (enzyme labeled
antibodies to human IgG) is added and incubated. If IgG antibodies to _T.
gondii_ are present, the conjugate will be immobilized in the wells. Residual
conjugate is eliminated by washing and the substrate is added. In the presence
of the enzyme, the substrate is converted to a yellow end product which is
read photometrically. Optical density was determined on a vMax microplate
reader and computer equipped with SOFTmax software (Molecular Devices Corp.,
Menlo Park, CA).

Quality control samples are included on every plate. The results of serologic
tests are of value as presumptive evidence of _T._ _gondii_ infection. The
test results are objective and normalized  as index values, or as
International Units (IU/mL), which are traceable to the WHO Anti-Toxoplasma
Serum, 3rd International Standard Preparation, 1994. Prior to the study the
Toxoplasma IgG EIA was evaluated using an established serum panel and
comparison with the CDC Toxoplasma immunofluorescence assay and the Sabin-
Feldman dye test and found to have a sensitivity and specificity of 100%.

## Data Processing and Editing

Data were submitted after all the antibody testing was complete. The data were
not edited.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The _Toxoplasma gondii_ EIA test is considered in control provided the quality
control serum is within two standard deviations of its mean.

## Analytic Notes

Results were measured as IU/ml. Samples with results ≥ 33 IU/mL should be
coded as Positive, samples with results < 27 IU/mL should be coded as
Negative, and samples with results ≥ 27 IU/mL and <33 IU/mL were considered
Equivocal. All results originally considered Equivocal were repeated at least
twice for confirmation and should be coded as Negative.
