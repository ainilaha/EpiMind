### Occupation (OCQ_G)

####  Data File: OCQ_G.xpt

##### First Published: November 2013

##### Last Revised: September 2017

##### Note: Industry and occupation group code variables have been added for
study participant's current and longest held jobs.

## Component Description

The Occupation Questionnaire section (variable name prefix OCQ; questions
OCD150 to OCQ580) contains survey participant interview data on employment and
variables relating to the work environment.

OCQ section Topics:

  * Data for Survey Participant's Current Job (OCD231-OCD270): weekly hours worked, public vs. private sector, industry and occupation group, and duration of employment. 
  * Exposure to Workplace Tobacco Smoke at the Current Job (OCQ275).
  * Data for the Survey Participant's Longest Job (OCD390G-OCD395): industry and occupation group, duration of employment. 
  * Data for the Survey Participant's Lifetime History of Exposure to Mineral and Organic Dusts, Gases, Fumes, and Vapors in the Workplace (OCQ510-OCQ580; administered to those ages 16-79 years).

## Eligible Sample

All survey participants aged 16 years and older were eligible.

## Interview Setting and Mode of Administration

These questions were asked, in the home, by trained interviewers using the
Computer-Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) system. Persons 16 years of age
are interviewed directly.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The CAPI system is programmed with built-in consistency checks to reduce data
entry errors. CAPI also uses online help screens to assist interviewers in
defining key terms used in the questionnaire. During the 2011-2012 data
collection cycle, periodic QC checks were performed on the Occupation
questionnaire data being collected and interviewer specific feedback and
retraining was performed as appropriate.

## Data Processing and Editing

Questionnaire interview responses were entered into a pentop computer and then
uploaded into a computerized database in the same manner as other sections of
the Survey Participant Questionnaire. The data was then edited for
completeness, consistency, and illogical values.

## Analytic Notes

In general, analysts are advised to carefully review the question wording in
the OCQ codebook also to make sure they understand question skip patterns and
the definitions employed for Occupation-related variables. Some OCQ questions
need to be considered as an integral part of data collection for other
questionnaire sections, exam or laboratory Components.

Please note that military occupations are not permissible entries for NHANES
current job data because for NHANES, only the civilian, non-institutionalized
population is eligible to participate in the survey. However, civilian
employees of the armed forces are included in the NHANES survey sample and
military occupations are valid entries for the survey participant's longest
job data.

Current Job Information:  
The primary focus of the OCQ Questionnaire is data collection for the
participant's work within the previous week (i.e., the participant's Current
Job). The participant's Current Job is defined as the main paid job worked
within the last week, including work on a family farm. When an individual
currently worked multiple jobs, the participant was asked to designate one
main job for the interview. Data collected included:

  * The number of hours worked last week--all jobs; 
  * Whether the participant usually works 35 or more hours/week; 
  * Industry and Occupation group code data; 
  * Sector of employment (private, public); 
  * Number of months worked on the current, main job; 
  * The main reason the participant did not work last week (if not currently working); and   
A history of workplace tobacco smoke exposure.

Longest Job Information:  
In NHANES 2011-12, both industry and occupation data and duration of
employment were collected for the subject's Longest Job. Industry information
is also available in instances where the longest job is the same as the
current job (OCD390G=2), or was the armed forces (OCD390G=3).

In NHANES 2011-12, additional questions were asked regarding a lifetime
history of exposure to mineral and organic dusts, gases, fumes, and vapors
(OCQ510-OCQ580). These questions were added to the survey as a part of an
expanded respiratory health data collection for these survey years.

Related NHANES 2011-12 Data:  
There are occupation-related items in the NHANES Physical Functioning (PFQ)
questionnaire (PFQ049 and PFQ051) and two questions on veteran's
status/military service in the Survey Participant Demographics (DEMO) data
file (DMQMILIZ and DMQADFC). In NHANES 2011-12 Respiratory Health data was
also collected: the dataset SPX contains Spirometry exam data; ENX contains
data on exhaled nitric oxide measurements; MCQ contains questionnaire data on
a prior medical diagnosis of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;
and RDQ contains questionnaire data on recent respiratory symptoms. The NHANES
smoking questionnaire (SMQ) and laboratory data for serum cotinine are
logically related to the workplace smoke exposure data collection.

Industry & Occupation Coding:  
Four digit codes were applied to the NHANES 2011-2012 occupation and industry
data using the 2002 U.S. Bureau of the Census Industrial & Occupational
Classification coding system. The coding was done by the Division of
Surveillance, Hazard Evaluations, and Field Studies (DSHEFS), which is part of
CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The 2002
Census Bureau industry codes are based on the year 2002 North American
Industry Classification System, and the 2002 Census Bureau occupation codes
are based on the year 2000 Standard Occupational Classification System. In the
OCQ_G public release data file, group code variables are provided that
classify an NHANES survey participant to one of 22 industry groups and to one
of 23 occupation groups. Access to the more detailed four-digit occupation and
industry variables is available through the NHANES Research Data Center (RDC).

Over the past six cycles, the coding system used to code NHANES data have
changed. Researchers need to review these coding systems to ensure that they
are coding and interpreting their findings correctly.

  * The U.S. Census Bureau's 2002 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was used for detailed coding of the 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012 occupation and industry group data. 
  * The U.S. Census Bureau's 2000 version of its Occupation and Industry coding system was used for detailed coding of the 2001-2002, 2003-2004, and 2005-2006 occupation and industry group data.

The 2000 and 2002 versions of the Census Bureau Industry and Occupation codes
are comparable in many, but not in all respects, and data analysts who wish to
combine NHANES cycles together should consult NIOSH's documentation on the
comparability of these 2 versions of the Census Bureau's coding system and
available crosswalks before performing their analyses.

Coding manuals, detailed data dictionaries of the alphabetical and classified
indices of industries and occupations, and information about crosswalks
between the coding systems are available (NIOSH, 2017).

Appendix A provides SASâ„¢ program format statements useful for formatting the
NHANES 2011-12 occupation and industry group code data. Appendix B provides
tables showing the detailed U.S. Census occupation and industry source codes
used in creating the NHANES 2011-12 occupation and industry group codes.

Detailed occupation and industry codes for the 1999-2000, 2001-2002, and
2003-2004 cycles are not available through the RDC, and at this time, there is
no timeline to release them.

The OCQ data were collected as part of the household questionnaire and,
therefore, the full sample NHANES interview weights WTINT2YR should be used
for statistical analysis. However, if the OCQ data are merged with the MEC
exam or laboratory data, then the NHANES examination sample weights WTMEC2YR
should be used for analyses. Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
