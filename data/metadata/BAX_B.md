### Balance (BAX_B)

####  Data File: BAX_B.xpt

##### First Published: February 2005

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Balance disorders constitute a major Public Health concern, especially for
older persons, an increasing segment of the U.S. general population. For
example, Balance disorders are causally related to the some 200,000 hip
fractures that occur annually in Americans over the age of 65. The objectives
of the Balance Component are to obtain accurate prevalence data on balance
problems among a sample of U.S. adults, to examine the relationship between
balance problems and specific covariates such as certain medical conditions
and indicators of health status, and to help characterize normal and
disordered balance and spatial perception.

The NHANES 2001-2002 Balance Component consisted of two parts:

1\. A pre-exam screening questionnaire: This is a series of questions to
identify conditions which would constitute either practical or safety
exclusions to performing Balance testing. Please note that more extensive
survey questions relating to balance problems are contained in the BAQ section
of the NHANES household survey questionnaire.

2\. Balance Testing: This part consisted of a modified Romberg Test of
Standing Balance on Firm and Complaint Support Surfaces (Weber, 1993).

## Eligible Sample

The 2001-2001 Balance Component tested a full sample of U.S. adults ages 40+
years. Subjects were excluded from the Balance testing protocol if at the time
of the exam, they felt unable to standon their own, were then currently having
dizziness sufficient to cause unsteadiness, weighed over 275 lbs., had a waist
circumference either too small or too large to accommodate proper fitting of
any standard-sized safety gait belt, if they needed a leg brace in order to
stand unassisted, or had an amputation of their feet or legs. In addition
subjects who were totally blind or visually impaired sufficiently to require
assistance in finding the exam room were disqualified.

## Protocol and Procedure

The Romberg Test of Standing Balance on Firm and Compliant Support Surfaces
examines the ability of the examinee to stand unassisted under four test
conditions, ordered in increasing level of difficulty. In TestCondition 1, the
subject stands making use of all the sensory inputs that contribute to
balance-- the central vestibular system, vision, and proprioception (leg
muscle position sense). Test Condition 2 tests balance when only vestibular
and proprioceptive information is available (the subject closes the eyes to
eliminate visual input). In Test Condition 3, the subject must maintain
balance on a foam-padded surface, which reduces the proprioceptive input,
leaving only visual and vestibular cues. Finally, in Test Condition 4 (also
using a foam pad) the eyes are again closed (visual input is removed) and the
subject's ability to maintain balance is tested using only the vestibular
system.

All Balance Testing was scored on a pass/fail basis, with Test Conditions 1
and 2 conducted for a total of 15 seconds, and Test Conditions 3 & 4 conducted
for 30 seconds each. Test failure was defined as 1) a subject needing to open
the eyes in an eyes-closed Test Condition (#2 or #4), 2) the subject moved the
arms or feet in order to achieve stability, or 3) the subject began to fall or
required MEC Technician intervention to maintain balance.

In the standard Balance Testing protocol, each subject is eligible for an
initial test and one re-test in order to pass a specific Test Condition.
Within each Test Condition, the protocol for retesting is the same as for the
primary examination. Because each successive Test Condition from 1 to 4 is
progressively more difficult than the Condition preceding it, the Balance
Testing Component is ended whenever a subject fails to pass a Test Condition.
Balance testing was conducted with the utmost consideration for subject
safety. The examining MEC Technician stood immediately to the side of the
participant prepared to stabilize the subject by the use of a safety gait belt
should significant unsteadiness occur. Also, the examination was conducted in
a small exam room, with well padded walls and floor.

The complete NHANES Balance Examination Procedures Manual is located at
<https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/1999-2000/manuals/ba.pdf>.

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

The NHANES Health Technicians were professionally trained in the Modified
Romberg Testing protocol by an expert consultant in Balance and Vestibular
disorders. In addition, audiologic consultants from the National Institute of
Occupational Safety & Health (NIOSH) provided performance monitoring of each
Technician on a regular basis. Also, NCHS staff visited the MECs approximately
twice per year to observe the Balance examinations and verify Compliance with
standard testing procedures. Finally, MEC Health Technicians received annual
retraining and updates by the NIOSH consultants. Exclusion rates and outcome
statistics for the examination component were continually monitored according
to Technician and MEC, and retraining was conducted as necessary to maintain
test quality.

## Data Processing and Editing

All of the Balance Data were collected using automated data collection
methods. A consulting NIOSH Audiologist performed data reviews. In addition, a
computerized data review and editing process was utilized to check for logical
inconsistencies in the data and technician errors, as well as to cross-check
other issues affecting data quality. Back-end edits of the data were performed
as necessary when errors were detected.

## Analytic Notes

Data analysts should ideally be familiar with Balance and Vestibular
disorders, or have a specialist available for consultation. The systematic
differences in testing length (15 seconds for Conditions 1 & 2; 30 seconds for
Conditions 3 & 4) may also need to be taken into account in the analysis of
the data.

Analysts wishing to perform data analysis using combined data from the NHANES
1999-2000 and NHANES 2001-2002 data collection cycles should be aware of the
differences in the sampling frame for Balance Examination that took place
between the two survey cycles. The NHANES 1999-2000 Balance Component was a Â½
sample of U.S. adults ages 40-69 years, whereas NHANES 2001-2002 was a full
sample of U.S. adults ages 40+ years. For analysis of the 1999-2000 Balance
data alone, the Balance Sub-Sample 2-Year MEC weights provided with that data
file should be utilized. For analysis of the 2001-2002 Balance data alone, the
regular full sample 2001-2002 MEC Examination weights should be used. For
combined 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 data analysis, the special 4-year Balance
Sub-Sample MEC weights provided with the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 data file
should be utilized. Please note that these 4-year sub-sample weights are
provided only for adults ages 40 to 69 years, which is the age range common to
both survey cycles.
