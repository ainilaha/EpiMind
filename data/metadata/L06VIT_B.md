### Vitamin A, Vitamin E & Carotenoids (L06VIT_B)

####  Data File: L06VIT_B.xpt

#####  First Published: October 2007

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objectives of this component are:

  1. to provide data for monitoring secular trends in measures of nutritional status in the U.S. population; 
  2. to evaluate the effect of people's habits and behaviors such as physical activity and the use of alcohol, tobacco, and dietary supplements on people's nutritional status; and 
  3. to evaluate the effect of changes in nutrition and public health policies including welfare reform legislation, food fortification policy, and child nutrition programs on the nutritional status of the U.S. population. 

These data will be used to estimate deficiencies and toxicities of specific
nutrients in the population and subgroups, to provide population reference
data, and to estimate the contribution of diet, supplements, and other factors
to serum levels of nutrients. Data will be used for research to further define
nutrient requirements as well as optimal levels for disease prevention and
health promotion.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 3 years and older who do not meet any of the exclusion
criteria are eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Serum concentrations of vitamins A (retinol) and E (Î± and Î³-tocopherol), two
retinyl esters, and six carotenoids (Î±-carotene, trans-Î²-carotene, cis Î²-
carotene, Î²-cryptoxanthin, combined lutein/zeaxanthin, and trans-lycopene)
are measured using high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode
array detection. A small volume (100 Î¼L) of serum is mixed with an ethanol
solution containing two internal standards- retinyl butyrate and nonapreno-Î²-
carotene (C45). The micronutrients are extracted from the aqueous phase into
hexane and dried under vacuum. The extract is redissolved in ethanol and
acetonitrile and is filtered to remove any insoluble material. An aliquot of
the filtrate is injected onto a C18 reversed phase column and isocratically
eluted with a mobile phase consisting of equal parts of ethanol and
acetonitrile. Absorbance of these substances in solution is linearly
proportional to concentration, thus spectrophotometric methods are used for
quantitative analysis. Three wavelengths, approximately corresponding to
absorption maxima, namely, 300, 325, and 450 nm, are simultaneously monitored
and chromatograms are recorded. Quantitation is accomplished by comparing the
peak height of the analyte in the unknown with the peak height of a known
amount of the same analyte in a calibrator solution. Calculations are
corrected based on the peak height of the internal standard in the unknown
compared with the peak height of the internal standard in the calibrator
solution. Retinol and the retinyl esters are compared with retinyl butyrate at
325 nm, Î±-and Î³-tocopherol are compared with retinyl butyrate at 300 nm, and
the carotenoids are compared with C45 at 450 nm.

## Data Processing and Editing

Serum specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, and Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis. Detailed specimen collection and
processing instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM. Vials were stored
under appropriate frozen (â20Â°C) conditions until they were shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

Eleven derived variables were created in this data file. The formula for their
derivatization is as follows:

The vitamin A (retinol) results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.03491.

The retinyl palmitate results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.03491.

The retinyl stearate results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.03491.

The vitamin E (Î±-tocopherol) results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.02322.

The Î³-tocopherol results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying
by 0.02402.

The Î±-carotene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying by
0.01863.

The trans-Î²-carotene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.01863.

The cis-Î²-carotene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying
by 0.01863.

The Î²-cryptoxanthin results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.01810.

The combined lutein/zeaxanthin results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by
multiplying by 0.01758.

The trans-lycopene results in ug/dL were converted into umol/L by multiplying
by 0.01863.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual
(LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.

There werenât any changes to the laboratory, method, or site from 1999-2000.

A detailed description of the quality assurance and quality control procedures
can be found on the NHANES website.

## Analytic Notes

The analysis of NHANES 2001â2002 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2001â2002
Household Questionnaire Data Files contain demographic data, health
indicators, and other related information collected during household
interviews. The Household Questionnaire Data Files also contain all survey
design variables and sample weights required to analyze these data. The
Phlebotomy Examination file includes auxiliary information on duration of
fasting, the time of day of the venipuncture, and the conditions precluding
venipuncture. The Household Questionnaire and Phlebotomy Exam files may be
linked to the laboratory data file using the unique survey participant
identifier SEQN.

**Regression Analysis for 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 for Vitamins A, E, and
Carotenoids:**

In 2001-2002, Vitamins A, E and Carotenoids were analyzed using a HPLC method
performed at CDC/NCEH. In 2003-2004, Vitamins A, E and Carotenoids were
analyzed using a comparable HPLC method at Craft Technologies, Inc. (CTI) [See
Lab 45 in NHANES 2003-2004 for method details]. Crossover studies between
CDC/NCEH and CTI were done in early 2003 and late 2004 and differences existed
between the methods for some analytes. The following Deming regression
analyses were performed to compare data from 2001-2002 to 2003-2004:
