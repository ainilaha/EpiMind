## Component Description

**Lead**

Lead is a known environmental toxin that has been shown to affect
deleteriously the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and reproductive
systems. In young children, lead exposure is a particular hazard because
children more readily absorb lead than adults, and children's developing
nervous systems also make them more susceptible to the effects of lead. The
primary sources of exposure for children are lead-laden paint chips and dust
as a result of deteriorating lead-based paint. The risk for lead exposure is
disproportionately higher for children who are poor, non-Hispanic black,
living in large metropolitan areas, or living in older housing. Among adults,
the most common high exposure sources are occupational. Blood lead levels
measured in previous NHANES cycles have been the cornerstone of lead exposure
surveillance in the U.S. The data have been used to document the burden and
dramatic decline of elevated blood lead levels, to promote the reduction of
lead use, and to help to redefine national lead poisoning prevention
guidelines, standards, and abatement activities.

**Cadmium**

Blood cadmium reflects both recent and cumulative exposures. Cadmium is
absorbed via inhalation and ingestion. Occupational exposure is the most
common cause of elevated cadmium levels. Inhalation of cigarette smoke is a
predominant source of exposure in smokers whose blood cadmium levels have been
observed to be about twice as high compared to nonsmokers. For nonsmokers who
are not exposed to cadmium in the workplace, ingestion through food is the
largest source of exposure. With chronic exposure, cadmium accumulates in the
liver and kidneys where it is bound to metallothionein, an inducible metal
binding protein. The kidney is a critical target and shows the earliest sign
of cadmium toxicity. Cadmium can produce lung, pituitary gland and kidney
tumors in animals and has been associated with lung cancer in humans in
occupational epidemiologic studies. Both International Agency for Research on
Cancer (IARC) and National Toxicology Program (NTP) consider cadmium a human
carcinogen.

**Manganese**

The greatest demand for manganese is for the production of iron and steel. In
addition, it is a key component of low-cost stainless steel and certain
aluminum alloys. At low concentrations, it is used to decolorize glass, while
at higher concentrations; it is used to make violet-colored glass. Manganese
dioxide, besides being a useful pigment, is a catalyst and a component of
certain dry cell batteries. Potassium permanganate is a potent oxidizer and
disinfectant. Manganese (in the form of manganese ions) is an essential trace
nutrient in all known forms of life. On the other hand, excess manganese is
toxic.

**Total Mercury**

Uncertainties exist regarding levels of exposure to methyl mercury from fish
consumption and potential health effects resulting from this exposure. Past
estimates of exposure to methyl mercury have been obtained from results of
food consumption surveys and measures of methyl mercury in fish. Measures of a
biomarker of exposure are needed for improved exposure assessments. Blood
mercury levels will be assessed in two subpopulations particularly vulnerable
to the health effects from mercury exposure: children 1-5 years old and women
of childbearing age. Blood measures of total and inorganic mercury will be
important for evaluation of exposure from exposure to mercury in interior
latex paints.

**Selenium**

Selenium salts are toxic in large amounts, but trace amounts are necessary for
cellular function in many organisms, including all animals. Selenium is a
component of the antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin
reductase (which indirectly reduce certain oxidized molecules in animals and
some plants). It is also found in three deiodinase enzymes, which convert one
thyroid hormone to another. Selenium requirements in plants differ by species,
with some plants requiring relatively large amounts, and others apparently
requiring none.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 1 year and older were eligible. Due to disclosure
concern, blood lead data from participants aged 1-5 years may only be accessed
through the [NCHS Research Data Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/index.htm).
Blood lead data from participants aged 6 years and older, and blood cadmium,
manganese, total mercury, and selenium data from all examined participants 1
years and older are included in this dataset. See Analytic Notes for
additional information on blood lead data from participants aged 1-5 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method directly measures lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), total mercury (Hg),
manganese (Mn), and selenium (Se) content of whole blood specimens using mass
spectrometry after a simple dilution sample preparation step.

During the sample dilution step, a small volume of whole blood is extracted
from a larger whole blood patient specimen after the entire specimen is mixed
(vortexed) to create a uniform distribution of cellular components. This
mixing step is important because some metals (e.g., Pb) are known to be
associated mostly with the red blood cells in the specimen and a uniform
distribution of this cellular material must be produced before a small volume
extracted from the larger specimen will accurately reflect the average metal
concentration of all fractions of the larger specimen. Coagulation is the
process in which blood forms solid clots from its cellular components. If
steps are not taken to prevent this process from occurring, i.e., addition of
anti-coagulant reagents such as EDTA in the blood collection tube prior to
blood collection, blood will immediately begin to form clots once leaving the
body and entering the tube. These clots prevent the uniform distribution of
cellular material in the blood specimen even after rigorous mixing, making a
representative sub-sample of the larger specimen unattainable. It is important
that prior to or during sample preparation the analyst identify any sample
having clots or micro-clots (small clots). Clotted samples are not analyzed by
this method due to the inhomogeneity concerns (i.e., all results for the
sample are processed as "not reportable").

Dilution of the blood in the sample preparation step prior to analysis is a
simple dilution of 1 part sample + 1 part water + 48 parts diluent. The
effects of the chemicals in the diluent are to release metals bound to red
blood cells making them available for ionization, reduce ionization
suppression by the biological matrix, prevent clogging of the sample
introduction system pathways by undissolved biological solids, and allow
introduction of internal standards to be utilized in the analysis step.
Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH, 0.4% v/v) and Triton X-100TM (0.05%) in
the sample diluent solubilizes blood components. Triton X-100TM also helps
prevent biological deposits on internal surfaces of the instrument's sample
introduction system and reduce collection of air bubbles in sample transport
tubing. Ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) in the sample diluent
(0.01%) aids in solubilizing metals released from the biological matrix. Ethyl
alcohol in the sample diluent (1%) aids solubility of blood components and
aids in aerosol generation by reduction of the surface tension of the
solution. The internal standards, rhodium, iridium, and tellurium, are at a
constant concentration in all blanks, calibrators, QC, and samples. Monitoring
the instrument signal ratio of a metal to its internal standard allows
correction for instrument noise and drift, and sample-to-sample matrix
differences.

Liquid samples are introduced into the mass spectrometer through the
inductively coupled plasma (ICP) ionization source. The liquid diluted blood
sample is forced through a nebulizer, which converts the bulk liquid into
small droplets in an argon aerosol. The smaller droplets from the aerosol are
selectively passed through the spray chamber by a flowing argon stream into
the ICP. By coupling radio-frequency power into flowing argon, plasma is
created in which the predominant species are positive argon ions and electrons
and has a temperature of 6000-8000 K. The small aerosol droplets pass through
a region of the plasma and the thermal energy vaporizes the liquid droplets,
atomizes the molecules of the sample and then ionizes the atoms. The ions,
along with the argon, enter the mass spectrometer through an interface that
separates the ICP (at atmospheric pressure, ~760 torr) from the mass
spectrometer (operating at a pressure of 10-5 torr). The ions first pass
through a focusing region, then the dynamic reaction cell (DRC), the
quadrupole mass filter, and finally are selectively counted in rapid sequence
at the detector allowing individual isotopes of an element to be determined.

Generally, the DRC operates in one of two modes. In 'vented' (or 'standard')
mode the cell is not pressurized and ions pass through the cell to the
quadrupole mass filter unaffected. In 'DRC' mode, the cell is pressurized with
a gas for the purpose of causing collisions and/or reactions between the fill
gas and the incoming ions. In general, collisions or reactions with the
incoming ions selectively occur to either eliminate an interfering ion, change
the ion of interest to a new mass, which is free from interference, or
collisions between ions in the beam and the DRC gas can focus the ion beam to
the middle of the cell and increase the ion signal. In this method, the
instrument is operated in DRC mode when analyzing for manganese, mercury, and
selenium. For selenium, the DRC is pressurized with methane gas (CH4, 99.999%)
which reduces the signal from 40Ar2+ while allowing the 80Se+ ions to pass
relatively unaffected through the DRC on toward the analytical quadrupole and
detector. Manganese and mercury are both measured when the DRC is pressurized
with oxygen gas (O2, 99.999%). They are analyzed at the same flow rate of
oxygen to the DRC cell to avoid lengthening analysis time due to pause delays
that would be necessary if different gas flows were used for the two analytes.
The oxygen reduces the ion signal from several interfering ions (37Cl18O+,
40Ar15N+, 38Ar16O1H+, 54Fe1H+) while allowing the Mn+ ion stream to pass
relatively unaffected through the DRC on toward the analytical quadrupole and
detector. In the case of mercury, collisional focusing of the mercury ions
occurs, increasing the observed mercury signal at the detector by
approximately a factor of two (2x).

Once ions pass through the DRC cell and electrically selected for passage
through the analytical quadrupole, electrical signals resulting from the ions
striking the discrete dynode detector are processed into digital information
that is used to indicate the intensity of the ions. The intensity of ions
detected while aspirating an unknown sample is correlated to an elemental
concentration through comparison of the analyte: internal standard signal
ratio with that obtained when aspirating calibration standards. This method
was originally based on the method by Lutz (Lutz et al., 1991). The DRC
portions of the method are based on work published by Tanner (Tanner, et al.
1999; 2002).

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to lab methods, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component for the 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Cadmium, Lead, Manganese, Mercury, and Selenium Lab Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/PBCD-J-PBY-
J-R-MET-508.pdf) (June 2020)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Whole blood specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the National
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-30°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.  
  
NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard et al., 1981)
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports are
reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to
explain any identified areas of concern.  
  
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences quality control and quality assurance performance criteria for
accuracy and precision, similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al., 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

Five additional variables were created for this data file. The variables were
created using the following formulas:

**LBDBCDSI:**   The analyte cadmium value in µg/L (LBXBCD) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDBCDSI) by multiplying LBXBCD by 8.897 (Round 2 decimal points).

**LBDBPBSI:**   The analyte lead value in µg/dL (LBXBPB) was converted to
µmol/L (LBDBPBSI) by multiplying LBXBPB by 0.0483 (Round 2 decimal points).

**LBDBMNSI:**   The analyte manganese value in µg/L (LBXBMN) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDBMNSI) by multiplying LBXBMN by 18.202 (Round 2 decimal points).

**LBDBSESI:**   The analyte selenium value in µg/L (LBXBSE) was converted to
µmol/L (LBDBSESI) by multiplying LBXBSE by 0.0127 (Round 2 decimal points).

**LBDTHGSI:**   The analyte mercury value in µg/L (LBXTHG) was converted to
nmol/L (LBDTHGSI) by multiplying LBXTHG by 4.99 (Round 2 decimal points).

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data Overview
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)for
general information on NHANES laboratory data.

There are over 800 laboratory tests performed on NHANES participants. However,
not all participants provided biospecimens or enough volume for all the tests
to be performed. The specimen availability can also vary by age or other
population characteristics. For example, in 2017-2018, approximately 80% of
children aged 1-17 years who were examined in the MEC provided a blood
specimen through phlebotomy, while 95% of examined adults age 18 and older
provided a blood specimen. Analysts should evaluate the extent of missing data
in the dataset related to the outcome of interest as well as any predictor
variables used in the analyses to determine whether additional re-weighting
for item non-response is necessary.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line [NHANES
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx)
for further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2017-2018 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

The [Fasting Questionnaire File
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/2017-2018/fastqx_j.htm)includes auxiliary
information, such as fasting status, length of fast, and the time of
venipuncture.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., LBDBCDLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. The other variable prefixed URX (ex., LBXBCD) provides the analytic
result for the analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower
limit of detection (ex. LBDBCDLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the
analyte results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by
the square root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]).  
The lower limit of detection (LLOD, in µg/L) for cadmium, manganese, total
mercury and selenium, and (LLOD, in ug/dL) for lead:

**Variable Name** |  **Analyte Description** |  **LLOD**  
---|---|---  
LBXBCD |  Cadmium, blood |  0.10  
LBXBPB |  Lead, blood |  0.07  
LBXMN |  Manganese, blood |  0.99  
LBXTHG |  Mercury, total, blood |  0.28  
LBXBSE |  Selenium, blood |  24.48  
  
**Data Access**

Blood Lead data for youth aged 1-5 years are included in file "Lead - Blood -
Youth (PBY_J_R)", and available through the [NCHS Research Data
Center](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/index.htm).
