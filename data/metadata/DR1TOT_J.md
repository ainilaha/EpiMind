### Dietary Interview - Total Nutrient Intakes, First Day (DR1TOT_J)

####  Data File: DR1TOT_J.xpt

##### First Published: June 2020

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

The objective of the dietary interview component is to obtain detailed dietary
intake information from NHANES participants. The dietary intake data are used
to estimate the types and amounts of foods and beverages (including all types
of water) consumed during the 24-hour period prior to the interview (midnight
to midnight), and to estimate intakes of energy, nutrients, and other food
components from those foods and beverages. Following the dietary recall,
participants are asked questions on salt use, whether the person's overall
intake on the previous day was much more than usual, usual or much less than
usual, and whether the participant is on any type of special diet. Questions
on frequency of fish and shellfish consumed during the past 30 days are asked
of participants 1 year or older, with the use of proxies for young children
(see the [MEC In-Person Dietary Interviewers Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_In-
Person_Dietary_Interviewers_Manual.pdf) for more information on the proxy
interview).

The dietary interview component, called What We Eat in America (WWEIA), is
conducted as a partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Under this
partnership, DHHS' National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Division of
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys is responsible for the survey sample
design and all aspects of data collection and USDA's Food Surveys Research
Group (FSRG) is responsible for the dietary data collection methodology,
maintenance of the databases used to code and process the data, and data
review and processing.

All NHANES participants are eligible for two 24-hour dietary recall
interviews. The first dietary recall interview is collected in-person in the
Mobile Examination Center (MEC) and the second interview is collected by
telephone 3 to 10 days later.

As in previous years, two types of dietary intake data are available for the
2017-2018 survey cycle: Individual Foods files and Total Nutrient Intakes
files.

**What's New with the 2017-2018 WWEIA Release:**

In the Total Nutrient files, question wording was changed slightly for salt
use questions at the table and in cooking or preparing foods; and the types of
salt changed by removing "seasoned salt" and adding "sea salt" (variables
DBQ095Z, DRQSPREP, DR1STY, DR1SKY). **Appendix 1** provides a summary of
changes among the 5 latest cycles of data collection. No new data variables
were added in the 2017-2018 WWEIA release.

**Dietary Interview Data Files:** Four data files were produced from the
information collected in the dietary interviews: two Individual Foods files
and two Total Nutrient Intakes files. Each file includes one day of intake
data. The number "1" or "2" in the file name identifies the day (and mode) of
the interview: 1 = first day (in-person), 2 = second day (phone). File names
are as follows:

File Names for Dietary Interview Data: File | Day 1 | Day 2  
---|---|---  
Individual Foods File | DR1IFF_J | DR2IFF_J  
Total Nutrient Intakes File | DR1TOT_J | DR2TOT_J  
  
The amounts in these files reflect only nutrients obtained from foods,
beverages, and water, including tap and bottled water. They do not include
nutrients obtained from dietary supplement intakes, antacids, or medications.
Data on intake of dietary supplement use are available on the [NHANES
2017-2018 Dietary
Data](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2017)
page.

**Individual Foods Files (DR1IFF_J and DR2IFF_J):**  Detailed information
about each food/beverage item (including the description, amount of, and
nutrient content) reported by each participant is included in the Individual
Foods files. The names for both Day 1 and Day 2 variables are listed in
**Appendix 2**.

The Individual Foods files include, for each interview day, one record for
each food/beverage consumed by a participant. Each record is uniquely numbered
within a participant's set of records and contains the information listed
below:

  * Number of days of complete intake obtained from participant;
  * Day of the week of the intake; 
  * Whether the food/beverage was eaten in combination with other foods, such as in a sandwich; 
  * Time of eating occasion/when the food was eaten; 
  * Eating occasion name; 
  * Where the food/beverage was obtained; 
  * Whether the meal/snack was eaten at home or not; 
  * A USDA FNDDS code identifying the food/beverage; 
  * Amount of food/beverage consumed, in grams; and 
  * Food energy and 64 nutrients/food components (listed in **Appendix 3**) from each food/beverage as calculated using USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2017-2018 (FNDDS 2017-2018).

Descriptions for the USDA FNDDS food codes are provided in the Food Code
Description file (DRXFCD_J). The DRXFCD_J file includes abbreviated
descriptions (up to 60 characters) and complete descriptions (up to 200
characters) associated with each USDA food code in the FNDDS 2017-2018.
**Appendix 4** provides SAS code examples that may be used to link the food
code description to the Individual Foods file.

**Total Nutrient Intakes Files (DR1TOT_J and DR2TOT_J):**  For each
participant, daily total energy and nutrient intakes from foods and beverages,
and whether the amount of food consumed was usual, much more than usual, or
much less than usual, are included in the Total Nutrient Intakes files. The
Day 1 file also includes information on salt use in cooking and at the table;
whether the participant is currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for
another health-related reason and, if so, the type of diet; and information on
frequency of fish and shellfish consumption for participants aged 1 or older.
The names for both Day 1 and Day 2 variables are listed in **Appendix 5**.

The Total Nutrient Intakes files provide a summary record of total nutrient
intakes for each participant. Each total intake record contains the following
information:

  * Number of days of complete intake obtained from participant; 
  * Day of the week of the intake; 
  * Type of salt used and how often added at the table and in food preparation (Day 1 file only);
  * Use of salt at the table yesterday and the type of salt used;
  * Whether the participant is currently on any kind of diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and, if so, the type of diet (Day 1 file only); 
  * Total number of foods and beverages including water reported for that participant for that day's intake; 
  * Daily aggregates of food energy and 64 nutrients/food components (listed in **Appendix 3**) from all foods/beverages as calculated using USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies 2017-2018 (FNDDS 2017-2018); 
  * Whether the amount of food consumed was usual, much more than usual, or much less than usual;
  * Total amount of tap and bottled water consumed (calculated as the sum of reports of water drunk by itself in the 24-hour recall) and the usual source of tap water; and
  * Frequency of fish and shellfish consumption in the past 30 days (participants one year or older, Day 1 file only).

## Eligible Sample

All NHANES participants were eligible for the dietary interview component.
However, only participants aged one year or older were eligible for the
frequency of fish and shellfish consumption questions following the 24-hour
recall.

## Protocol and Procedure

The examination protocol and data collection methods are fully documented in
the NHANES dietary interviewer procedures manuals ([In-person
interview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_In-
Person_Dietary_Interviewers_Manual.pdf) and [phone follow-up
interview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/NHANES-2018-PhoneFollowUpDietaryManual-508.pdf)).

Interviews were conducted for participants less than six years of age with a
proxy (who was generally the person most knowledgeable about the participant's
intake). Interviews of children aged 6 to 8 were conducted with a proxy and
the child was present to assist in reporting intake information. Interviews of
children aged 9-11, were conducted with the child and the assistance of a
proxy familiar with the child's intake. Participants 12 years or older
answered for themselves. Dietary interviewers conducted in-person interviews
in English and Spanish.

Translators were used to conduct interviews in other languages.

The in-person interview was conducted in a private room in the NHANES MEC. A
set of measuring guides (various glasses, bowls, mugs, bottles, household
spoons, measuring cups and spoons, a ruler, thickness sticks, bean bags, and
circles) was available in the MEC dietary interview room for the participant
to use for reporting amounts of foods ([NHANES Measuring Guides for the
Dietary Recall
Interview](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/measuring_guides_dri/measuringguides.htm)).
Upon completion of the in-person interview, participants were given measuring
cups, spoons, a ruler, and a food model booklet, which contained two-
dimensional drawings of the various measuring guides available in the MEC, to
use for reporting food amounts during the telephone interview. Telephone
dietary interviews were collected 3 to 10 days following the MEC dietary
interview and were generally scheduled on a different day of the week as the
MEC interview. Only a small number of participants (n=99) were interviewed on
the same day of the week for both day 1 and day 2 interviews due to their
scheduling availability. Any participant who did not have a telephone was
given a toll-free number to call so that the recall could be conducted.

What We Eat in America data were collected using USDA's dietary data
collection instrument, the Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM), available
at: <http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg>. The AMPM was designed to provide
an efficient and accurate means of collecting intakes for large-scale national
surveys. The AMPM is a fully computerized recall method that uses a 5-step
interview outlined below:

  1. **Quick List** \- Participant recalls all foods and beverages consumed the day before the interview (midnight to midnight). 
  2. **Forgotten Foods** \- Participant is asked about consumption of foods commonly forgotten during the Quick List step. 
  3. **Time and Occasion** \- Time and eating occasion are collected for each food. 
  4. **Detail Cycle** \- For each food, a detailed description, amount eaten, and additions to the food are collected. Eating occasions and times between eating occasions are reviewed to elicit forgotten foods. 
  5. **Final Probe** \- Additional foods not remembered earlier are collected. 

The AMPM includes an extensive compilation of standardized food-specific
questions and possible response options. Routing of questions is based on
previous responses. The AMPM is updated for each 2-year collection of WWEIA to
reflect the changing food supply and to address research needs from the data
user community. Additional information about the AMPM is provided in Raper et
al. (Raper et al., 2004).

The AMPM was validated in a large study and shown to be an effective method
for collecting accurate group energy intake of adults. Completed in 2004, this
extensive research project included 524 healthy, weight-stable volunteers,
aged 30-69 years. The accuracy of the AMPM was evaluated by comparing reported
energy intake (EI) to total energy expenditure (TEE) using the doubly labeled
water technique (Moshfegh et al., 2008). Among the findings were that EI
compared to TEE was under-reported by 11% overall, by less than 3% for normal
weight subjects with body mass index (BMI) < 25 and 16% for overweight
subjects with BMI ≥ 25\.

Additional studies provide evidence that the AMPM accurately measures group
energy intake. Blanton (Blanton et al., 2006) reported that EI was not
significantly different from TEE for a sample of 20 adult females. Rumpler and
colleagues found that mean EIs were accurately reported for a sample of 12
adult males (Rumpler et al., 2008).

Additional evidence for the accuracy of AMPM has been provided by analysis of
the 24-hour urinary sodium data collected in the AMPM Validation Study, which
suggest the AMPM is a valid measure for estimating mean sodium intake in
adults. Dietary sodium intake calculated from 24-hour recall data of 465
subjects collected via AMPM was compared with sodium values from 24-hour urine
collections measured during the same 24-hour period. The AMPM-derived mean
dietary sodium estimates reflected over 90% of the biomarker-based estimates
(Rhodes et al., 2013).

survey protocols, please visit the [NHANES
website](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/manuals.aspx?BeginYear=2017).

## Quality Assurance & Quality Control

All dietary interviewers were required to complete an intensive one-week
training course and to conduct supervised practice interviews before working
independently in the field. Retraining sessions were conducted annually to
reinforce the proper protocols and technique.

Interviewers were monitored throughout the data collection period. Monitoring
consisted of the following:

  * Reviews of audio recorded interviews or in-person observations, which were conducted for approximately 5% of each interviewer's work. 
  * Quality control of interviews, which were checked for completeness of the recalls, missing information, inconsistent reports, and unclear notes. Written notification and feedback were provided to the interviewers. 

## Data Processing and Editing

Interview data files were sent electronically from the field and were imported
into Survey Net, a computer-assisted food coding and data management system
developed by USDA (Raper et al., 2004).

USDA's Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) 2017-2018 was
used for processing the 2017-2018 intakes
(<http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg>). The FNDDS includes comprehensive
information that can be used to code individual foods/beverages and portion
sizes reported by participants and includes nutrient values for calculating
nutrient intakes. FNDDS nutrient values are updated for every 2-year WWEIA,
NHANES release cycle. The basis for the nutrient values in FNDDS are detailed
in the documentation for FNDDS 2017- 2018 available at
<http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg>.

Coders were required to pass a certification test after the initial training.
They were routinely monitored to ensure the quality and completeness of their
work. Approximately 10 percent of the coder's work was randomly selected to be
independently coded by another coder. Results from the two codings were
compared and adjudicated, if necessary.

After intake data were coded, various types of reviews and quality assurance
procedures were conducted by FSRG scientists to ensure the quality of the
data. Examples of reviews include the following:

  * Interviewers' and coders' questions and comments were reviewed to ensure that they have been addressed. 
  * Decisions made by coders about how to code new or unusual foods/beverages or quantities reported by participants were reviewed by FSRG scientists. Items of question were resolved by FSRG scientists.
  * Specific data integrity checks for reasonableness, consistency, and logic were conducted. 

## Analytic Notes

Each Individual Foods file (Day 1 and Day 2) is comprised of food records. For
most participants, there are multiple records in each file. For each Total
Nutrient Intakes file (Day 1 and Day 2) there is one record for each
participant. These files can be linked with other NHANES files by the
respondent sequence number (SEQN).

**Variable names:** For data collected on both Day 1 and Day 2, variable names
are differentiated by having the number "1" or "2" in the third position of
the variable name to identify the collection day. For example, the USDA food
code variable (in the Individual Foods File), which identifies the food
reported by the participant, is named DR1IFDCD in the Day 1 file and DR2IFDCD
in the Day 2 file.**** Appendices******2** and **5** list the Day 1 and Day 2
variable names for the Individual Foods file and the Total Nutrient Intakes
file, respectively.

Names for the following variables are the same for both days in the Individual
Foods file and the Total Nutrient Intakes file:

**Variables with the Same Name for Both Days in the Dietary Interview Files** Day 1 and Day 2 variable name | Label  
---|---  
SEQN | Respondent sequence number  
WTDRD1 | Dietary day one sample weight  
WTDR2D | Dietary two-day sample weight  
DRABF | Breast-fed infant (either day)  
DRDINT | Number of days of intake  
  
**Number of days of intake:** A variable has been included to indicate the
number of days of intake collected from each participant. The variable name is
DRDINT. In 2017-2018, 7,641 participants provided complete dietary intakes for
Day 1. Of those providing the Day 1 data, 6,639 provided complete dietary
intakes for Day 2.

**Dietary recall status code:** A status code (DR1DRSTZ or DR2DRSTZ) is used
in both the Individual Foods and Total Nutrient Intakes files to indicate the
quality and completeness of a survey participant's response to the dietary
recall section. The codes are the following:

1 = Reliable and met the following minimum criteria:

  * The first 4 steps of the 5-step AMPM completed.
  * Food/beverages consumed for each reported eating occasion identified.

For individuals with a code 1, all relevant variables associated with the
24-hour dietary recall contain a value.

2 = Not reliable or did not meet the minimum criteria

Individuals with a code 2 have incomplete records. No data on total nutrient
intakes and the total number of foods reported are provided for these cases.
These individuals have no records in the Individual Foods files.

3     [Code 3 is not included in the current datasets. It was only used for
data from the 1999-2000 survey cycle.]

4 = Reported consuming breast milk

For infants and children who consumed human milk, there is a record in the
Individual Foods files for each report of human milk. However, because amounts
of human milk intake are not quantified, these records contain missing values
for the amount consumed and for the amounts of energy and nutrients from human
milk. Also, records of human milk have a missing value for the food source
variable (DR1FS, DR2FS) and the eaten at home variable (DR1_040Z, DR2_040Z) in
the Individual Foods files. Records for any other foods and beverages consumed
by breast-fed infants and children are included in the Individual Foods files
along with their amounts and nutrient information. Because of the missing
amount or quantity information for human milk, no total nutrient intakes
(contained in the Total Nutrient Intakes files) were computed for participants
with a code 4.

A variable that identifies breast-fed children, DRABF, is included. This
variable has a code of 1 if a child consumed human milk in either intake day.

5 = Not done

This code is assigned when the dietary recall section of the interview did not
take place due to various reasons (such as arrived late/left early, refusal,
illness, emergency, or equipment failure). These individuals have no records
in the Individual Foods files. These individuals have a record in the Total
Nutrients file with values only for the following variables: the respondent
sequence number (SEQN), the dietary recall status code (DR1DRSTZ or DR2DRSTZ)
and for participants one year or older, the fish and shellfish questions in
the DR1TOT_J file (DRD340, DRD350A-K, DRD350AQ-JQ, DRD360, DRD370A-V, and
DRD370AQ-UQ).

Only codes 1 and 4 appear in the Individual Foods file.

**Distinguishing Between Foods/Beverages and Dietary Supplements in NHANES**

The 24-hour dietary supplement use component is administered after the 24-hour
dietary recall. All NHANES participants responding to the 24-hour dietary
recall interview are eligible for the dietary supplement and non-prescription
antacid use questions. Information is obtained on all vitamins, minerals,
herbals, and other dietary supplements as well as non-prescription antacids
that were consumed during a 24-hour time period (midnight to midnight),
including the name and the amount of supplement or antacid taken.

Distinguishing between foods/beverages and supplements can be challenging.
NCHS and FSRG review questionable items reported in the dietary supplement and
dietary recall components to resolve disposition of these items into the
appropriate component. Products that are labeled as a dietary supplement, that
have a supplement facts panel on the label, and are in tablets, capsules,
softgels, gelcaps, or other pill forms, are considered dietary supplements.
Items that are powders or liquids can be hard to distinguish. General
guidelines used state that if powders and liquid concentrates have product
directions stating that they be added to a liquid, they are classified as
beverages. Examples are teas and protein powders. An exception is made for
fiber products, which are classified as dietary supplements. Along this same
guideline, energy drinks are considered beverages, but "energy shot" type
products are considered dietary supplements.

It is best to refer to the two databases that detail every food/beverage and
dietary supplement reported in NHANES to identify exact determination used.
The databases are:

  * [2017-2018 Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary ](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/food-surveys-research-group)
  * [NHANES Dietary Supplement Database ](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Dietary&CycleBeginYear=2017)

**Participants who reported consuming only water, no food or other
beverages:** Records are included in the Individual Foods file for
participants who consumed only water. There are 2 such individuals in the
2017-2018 datasets, none in the Day 1 data and 2 in the Day 2 data.  
Their dietary recall status variable for the day is coded as "1" (complete and
reliable) in the Total Nutrients file and the total number of items is the
number of times water was reported. Individuals with just water intake and no
food intake will have zero energy intake for the day.

**Participants who reported consuming no water, food or other beverages:**
There can be participants whose intakes are determined to be complete even
though they reported no water, food, or other beverage records for the day.
For such participants there are no records in the Individual Foods file but
their dietary recall status is coded as complete and reliable and the Total
Nutrients file will include records with zero values for all nutrients. In the
2017-2018 datasets, there is 1 individual in the day 1 data that reported no
water, food, or other beverage records for the day.

**Number of days between the intake day and the day of family interview:**
Each of the four intake files includes a variable (DR1DBIH for Day 1 files and
DR2DBIH for Day 2 files) to indicate the number of days between the intake day
(i.e., the period covered by the 24-hour recall) and the day that the family
questionnaire was administered in the household. A positive value in DR1BHIH
or DR2BHIH indicates the family interview occurred prior to the intake day. In
the survey, most of the family interviews were done before the participant
came to the MEC and participated in the dietary interview. A value of "0" in
DR1BHIH or DR2BHIH indicates the family interview occurred on the same date as
the intake day. A negative value (i.e., DR1BHIH<0 or DR2BHIH<0) means that the
family interview occurred after the intake day.

**Food source:** The source from which each food/beverage was obtained (e.g.,
from a store, fast food restaurant, cafeteria) is identified by the variables
DR1FS (day 1) and DR2FS (day 2) in the Individual Foods files.

The code descriptions for this variable are:

Eating occasion was designated by the respondent. During the interview, a list
of eating occasion names was available to the respondent for selection.
However, eating occasion names were not defined for the respondent.

**Foods and beverages coded as part of a combination:** 42 percent of foods
and beverages reported in WWEIA, NHANES 2017-2018 were identified as items
consumed together as combinations. Items consumed as a combination were
identified by one of fifteen unique "combination food types." Foods and
beverages not coded in combination have the code "0" for the combination food
type variable.

The combination types provide a linkage for:

  * Foods or beverages with additions, such as cereal with milk, coffee with cream; 
  * Multi-component foods that have specific protocol for collection such as some salads and   
sandwiches; and  

  * Other combinations that do not have a unique code in the FNDDS. 

**Combination Type, Code, Examples, and Percent of Food and Beverages Reported by Type, 2017-2018, Day 1** Combination Type | Code | Examples of Combination Type | % Items  
---|---|---|---  
Not in combination | 0 | NA | 58  
Beverage w/ additions | 1 | Coffee, tea with: milk, cream, sugar. Infant formula with: baby cereal. | 9  
Cereal w/ additions | 2 | Cereals (ready-to-eat, cooked, baby) with: milk, sugar, fruit, butter. | 4  
Bread/baked product w/additions | 3 | Breads, rolls, pancakes with: butter, jam, syrup, fruit. Cakes, pies with: ice cream, toppings. Crackers with: cheese, dip, peanut butter. | 4  
Salad | 4 | Components of salads that do not have a single code in FNDDS. It may also designate additional items to single code salads. | 4

Chips w/ additions | 14 | Potato chips, corn chips with: dip, cheese, salsa. | <1  
Other mixtures | 90 | Rice, pasta, spaghetti, eggs, other mixtures with: butter, gravy, sauce, condiments. | 3  
  
All items given a combination food type are given an additional variable to
identify each of the items within the combination. This variable is the
"combination food number" that is unique to the combination food type within
the individual intake.

**Variable Labels and Names for Combination Coding** Combination Coding | Variable Name, Day 1 | Variable Name, Day 2

Combination food number | DR1CCMNM | DR2CCMNM  
  
**The What We Eat in America Food Categories** , available on the FSRG website
(<http://www.ars.usda.gov/nea/bhnrc/fsrg>), is a grouping scheme that combines
foods and beverages together that have similar usage and nutrient content with
the emphasis on how they are commonly consumed in the American diet. There are
more than 160 unique categories and each is assigned a 4-digit number and
description. The WWEIA Food Categories contain discrete food items and are not
disaggregated (e.g., pizza vs. grain, cheese, tomatoes, etc.). Designed to be
flexible, the categories can be combined as needed to address specific
research questions. A new version of the WWEIA Food Categories is produced for
each 2-year release cycle of WWEIA, NHANES.

**Special diet:** Information on whether the participant is currently on any
kind of diet to lose weight or for other health-related reason and, if so, the
type of diet, was provided. The variable DRQSDIET identifies whether a
participant was on a special diet. The variables DRQSDT1 through DRQSDT12 and
DRQSDT91 identify the type of diet or diets that the participant was
following. These variables can be found in the Total Nutrient Intakes file.

**Sample weights for dietary intake data:** The NHANES participants were
selected on the basis of a national probability design. In order to increase
the number of participants for specific demographic groups, a multi-stage,
unequal probability of selection design was implemented. Beginning with the
2011-2012 data collection the NHANES sample design includes an oversample of
Asian Americans.

Sample weights are constructed that encompass the unequal probabilities of
selection, as well as adjustments for non-participation by selected sample
persons. In order to produce national, representative estimates, **the
appropriate sample weights must be used**.

For NHANES 2017-2018, there were 16,211 persons selected; of these 8,704 were
considered participants to the MEC examination and data collection. A total of
7,641 MEC participants provided complete dietary intakes for Day 1, and of
those providing the Day 1 data, 6,639 provided complete dietary intakes for
Day 2.

Most analyses of NHANES data use data collected in the MEC and the variable
WTMEC2YR should be used for the sample weights. However, for the WWEIA dietary
data, different sample weights are recommended for analysis. Although attempts
are made to schedule MEC exams uniformly throughout the week, proportionally
more exams occur on weekend days than on weekdays. Because food intake can
vary by weekdays and weekends, use of the MEC weights disproportionately
represents intakes on weekends.

A set of weights (WTDRD1) is provided that should be used when an analysis
uses the Day 1 dietary recall data (either alone or when Day 1 nutrient data
are used in conjunction with MEC data). The set of weights (WTDRD1) is
applicable to the 7,641 participants with Day 1 data.  
Day 1 weights were constructed by taking the MEC sample weights (WTMEC2YR) and
further adjusting for (a) the additional non-response and (b) the differential
allocation by weekdays (Monday through Thursday), Fridays, Saturdays and
Sundays for the dietary intake data collection. These Day 1 weights are more
variable than the MEC weights, and the sample size is smaller, so estimated
standard errors using Day 1 data and Day 1 weights might be larger than
standard errors for similar estimates based on MEC weights.

When analysis is based on both days of dietary intake, only 6,639 sample
participants have complete data. The NHANES protocol requires an attempt to
collect the second day of dietary data at least 3 days after the first day,
but the actual number of days between the two interviews is variable. A set of
adjusted weights, WTDR2D, is to be used when an analysis uses the smaller
sample with completed Day 1 and Day 2 dietary data. This two-day weight was
constructed for the 6,639 participants by taking the Day 1 weights (WTDRD1)
and further adjusting for (a) the additional non-response for the second
recall and (b) for the proportion of weekend (Friday through Sunday) and
weekday (Monday through Thursday) combinations of Day 1 and Day 2 recalls.

Note that all sample weights are person-level weights and each set of dietary
weights should sum to the same overall population control total as the MEC
weights (WTMEC2YR). In addition, the MEC weights (WTMEC2YR) are appropriate
for use in the analysis of the fish and shellfish consumption data (i.e.,
variables DRD340, DRD350A-K, DRD350AQ-JQ DRD360, DRD370A-V, and DRD370AQ-UQ)
located in the Day 1 Total Nutrient Intake File (DR1TOT_J), if no other
dietary data are included in the analysis. Additional explanation of sample
weights and appropriate uses are included in the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx). Please
also refer to the on-line [NHANES
Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for further
details on other analytic issues.

## Appendix 4. Adding Food Code Descriptions to Your Files

One supporting file is included with the Individual Foods files: the Food Code
Description file (DRXFCD_J).

The DRXFCD_J file includes abbreviated descriptions (up to 60 characters) and
complete descriptions (up to 200 characters) associated with each USDA food
code included in the Individual Foods files.

The Food Code Description file (DRXFCD_J) contains three variables:

> **DRXFDCD** a numeric value corresponding to DR1IFDCD in the file DR1IFF_J
> or DR2IFDCD in the file DR2IFF_J;
>
> **DRXFCSD** a short description (up to 60 characters) of the food code;
>
> **DRXFDLD** a long description (up to 200 characters) of the food code.

The following SQL code is an example of appending the shorter food code
description (here renamed DR1IFCSD) to one of the Individual Foods files using
PROC SQL from SAS®. Other SQL implementations may be different.

**proc sql;  
   create table DR1IFF_J_PLUS as  
   select iff.*, desc.DRXFCSD as DR1IFCSD  
   from NHANES.DR1IFF_J iff  
   left join NHANES.DRXFCD_J desc  
   on iff.DR1IFDCD = desc.DRXFDCD  
   order by SEQN, DR1ILINE;  
quit;**

SAS® users may wish to use Proc Format to assign labels to the food codes. The
following example generates and saves a picture format for food codes and a
separate format for each food code that includes both the food code itself and
the short food code description. It is assumed that the user has stored the
Individual Foods files and the Food Code Description file in a library called
NHANES and wishes to store the formats there as well.

**options fmtsearch = (NHANES);**

**proc format library = library;  
   picture foodcode  
   low - high = '000-00000';  
quit;**

**data tmp;  
   set NHANES.DRXFCD_J;  
   length cfoodcode $9 label $72;  
   cfoodcode = put(DRXFDCD, foodcode.);  
   label = cfoodcode || '  ' || DRXFCSD;  
run;**

**data fmt (keep = fmtname start label);  
   set tmp;  
   retain fmtname 'DRXFDCD';  
   rename DRXFDCD = start;  
run;**

**proc format cntlin = fmt library = library;  
run;**
