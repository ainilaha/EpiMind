### Chlamydia - Urine (CHLMDA_I)

####  Data File: CHLMDA_I.xpt

##### First Published: December 2017

##### Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Sexually transmitted infections caused by Chlamydia trachomatis may lead to
pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and chronic
pelvic pain in women. They are associated with increased risk of HIV
transmission. Pregnant women may transmit infection to their newborn, causing
serious medical complications.

NHANES offers an opportunity to assess the prevalence of chlamydia in the
general population and to monitor trends in prevalence as prevention programs
are established and expanded.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 14-39 years were eligible. This public data file
only includes examined participants aged 18-39 years. See Analytic Notes for
information on participants aged 14-17 years.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

The BDProbeTec CT Chlamydia trachomatis Amplified DNA Assays are based on the
simultaneous amplification and detection of target DNA, using amplification
primers and a fluorescent labeled detector probe. The Strand Displacement
Amplification (SDA) reagents are dried in two separate disposable microwell
strips. The processed sample is added to the Priming Microwell, which contains
the amplification primers, fluorescent labeled detector probe, and other
reagents necessary for amplification. After incubation, the reaction mixture
is transferred to the Amplification Microwell, which contains two enzymes (a
DNA polymerase and a restriction endonuclease) necessary for SDA. The
Amplification Microwells are sealed to prevent contamination and then
incubated in a thermally controlled fluorescent reader, which monitors each
reaction for the generation of amplified products.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab methods, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2015-2016 cycle.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine samples were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of STD
Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB
Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD and TB, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (â30Â°C) conditions until they are
shipped to the Division of STD Prevention Laboratory for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2015-2016/manuals/2016_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on âdry runâ sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.% of all specimens.  

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2015 \- 2016 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2015)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx#analytic-
guidelines) and the on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further details on the use
of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES 2015-2016 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2015)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample weight variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to other NHANES data files using the
unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The public release data file includes Chlamydia - urine data for participants
aged 18â39. Chlamydia - urine data for youth aged 14â17 years are
available through the [NCHS Research Data Center
(RDC)](http://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

**Detection Limits**  
Since this data is reported as qualitative data the use of lower LLODs isnât
applicable.
