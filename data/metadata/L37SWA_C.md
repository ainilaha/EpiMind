### Human Papillomavirus (HPV) DNA - Vaginal Swab: Digene Hybrid Capture &
Prototype Line Blot Assay (L37SWA_C)

####  Data File: L37SWA_C.xpt

##### First Published: March 2009

##### Last Revised: October 2010

##### Note: We recommend all analysis of HPV DNA PCR be conducted using the
Roche LA results (Data set name: L37SWR_C) in order to provide the most
accurate longitudinal information on HPV detection and typing by PCR.

## Component Description

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is one of the most common sexually
transmitted infections in the United States. Cervical infection with certain
types of HPV is a major risk factor for cervical cancer in women. The "high-
risk" types of HPV (e.g., HPV 16, 18) are associated with cervical cancer and
the "low-risk" types (e.g., HPV 6, 11) with genital warts. No national
surveillance system exists to measure the full burden of HPV infection, and no
reliable national population estimate of HPV exists. NHANES offers a unique
opportunity to assess the prevalence of HPV infection in the general
population.

Reducing the prevalence of HPV infection is a Healthy People 2010 objective:
"Reducing the number of new HPV cases can help minimize the overall number of
cases of high risk subtypes associated with cervical cancer in females..."
Detection and typing of HPV DNA in vaginal swabs (in conjunction with testing
of NHANES sera for HPV antibody) will allow evaluation of trends in prevalence
of type-specific HPV infection by age, sexual behavior, and race/ethnicity.
Two HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Cervarix) are licensed and recommended for use
in girls and women. Routine vaccination is recommended for girls 11 or 12
years of age, and catch-up vaccination through 26 years. One vaccine
(Gardasil) is licensed and available for boys and men. As vaccine becomes more
widely used, the national prevalence of HPV infection will be critical for
planning vaccination strategies in the United States.

Results of the Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test and HPV typing based on the Roche
prototype line blot assay have been previously released. The current data
release adds HPV typing results based on the Roche research use only Linear
Array (LA) HPV Genotyping kit (Dataset name: L37swr_c). The LA typing assay is
based upon the same assay principles as the prototype, but includes
proprietary refinements to improve sensitivity and reproducibility.

## Eligible Sample

We recommend all analysis of HPV DNA PCR be conducted using the Roche LA
results (Data set name: L37SWR_C) in order to provide the most accurate
longitudinal information on HPV detection and typing by PCR.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

**Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test**

LBXH2RL (Hybrid Capture high risk result)  
LBXH3RL (Hybrid Capture low risk result)

The Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test using Hybrid Capture 2 technology is a nucleic
acid hybridization microplate assay with signal amplification. It uses
chemiluminescence for the qualitative detection of eighteen types of human
papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in cervical specimens. The hc2 HPV DNA Test can
differentiate between two HPV DNA groups: low-risk HPV types (LR) 6, 11, 42,
43, 44; and high/intermediate-risk HPV types (HR)16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45,
51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 68. It cannot determine the specific HPV type present.

Specimens containing the target DNA hybridize with the HR or LR HPV RNA probe
cocktail. The resultant RNA:DNA hybrids are captured onto the surface of a
microplate well coated with antibodies specific for RNA:DNA hybrids.
Immobilized hybrids are then reacted with alkaline phosphatase conjugated
antibodies specific for the RNA:DNA hybrids, and detected with a
chemiluminescent substrate. As the substrate is cleaved by the bound alkaline
phosphatase, light is emitted which is measured as relative light units (RLUs)
on a luminometer. The intensity of the light emitted denotes the presence or
absence of target DNA in the specimen. An RLU measurement equal to or greater
than the Cutoff Value indicates the presence of HPV DNA sequences in the
specimen. An RLU measurement less than the Cutoff Value indicates the absence
of the specific HPV DNA sequences tested or HPV DNA levels below the detection
limit of the assay.  

**Prototype Line Blot Assay**

This assay uses HPV L1 consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
biotinylated PGMY09/11 primer sets and β-globin as an internal control for
sample amplification. The primer mix amplifies essentially all HPV types found
in the genital tract. The amplicons are evaluated by gel electrophoresis for
the presence of the 450 bp HPV amplicon. Positive samples are typed by
hybridization to the Roche prototype line probe typing strips followed by
colorimetric detection. The strip is a linear array of probes specific for 37
HPV types (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55,
56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 84, IS39,
and 89) and for the positive β-globin control as well. Types are read by
comparing the reaction pattern to the typing template. Samples that do not
hybridize to the typing strip are sequenced to determine the HPV type.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Vaginal swab samples were processed, stored and shipped to the Chronic Viral
Diseases Branch, Division of High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology,
National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA for analysis.

The Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test is approved for clinical testing, but the self-
collected vaginal sample does not meet clinical guidelines. The HPV PCR tests
are research tests. The HPV laboratory followed strict research QC/QA and was
CLIA certified August 2008\. Detailed quality control and quality assurance
instructions are discussed in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists
Procedures Manual (LPM). Read the LABDOC file for detailed QA/QC protocols.
The analytical methods are described in the **Description of the Laboratory
Methodology** section.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2003-2004/manuals/lab.pdf). Swabs
were stored at room temperature until they were shipped to the National Center
for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases for testing.

Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES
[LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2003-2004/manuals/lab.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

Progress reports containing any problems encountered during shipping or
receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC graphs,
instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are submitted
to NCHS quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data.
The laboratories are required to explain any identified areas of concern.

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2003-2004 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2003)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Sample Weights**

MEC exam sample weights should be used for analyses.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The NHANES [2003-2004 Demographics
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2003-2004/DEMO_C.XPT) contains
demographic data, health indicators, and other related information collected
during household interviews as well as the sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).

The Questionnaire data files contain socio-economic data, health indicators,
and other related information collected during household interviews. Certain
sensitive data on participants under 18 years of age (e.g., HPV typing
results, sexual behavior variables) are not included in the public use files.
These data may be requested as described in the NHANES guidelines.

The public release data file includes HPV vaginal swab data for participants
aged 18-59. HPV vaginal swab data for youth aged 14-17 years are available
through the [NCHS Research Data Center (RDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/).

HPV DNA detection and typing results from two assays are provided: the Roche
prototype line blot assay (previously released, Data set name: l37SWA_C) and
the Roche research use only Linear Array (LA) HPV Genotyping kit (Data set
name: l37SWR_C). The Roche prototype reagents were discontinued when the LA
assay was released and will not be available for further use in future NHANES
cycles. While based on identical principles, the LA was refined for
commercialization as a research use only kit. The two assays were comparable,
although LA was found to be more sensitive and detected more types per sample
(3, 4, 5). To assure comparability of results in the ongoing NHANES sampling,
residual extracts from 2003-2004 were retested with LA.

• **We recommend all analysis of HPV DNA PCR be conducted using the Roche LA
results (Data set name: L37SWR_C) in order to provide the most accurate
longitudinal information on HPV detection and typing by PCR.**

Note: The two data sets can also be distinguished by the variable names. The
data for the Roche prototype line blot assay has a fourth letter of the
variable name, H. The Roche LA assay has the fourth letter of the variable
name, R.

**Digene hc2 HPV DNA Test**

An RLU measurement equal to or greater than the Cutoff Value of 1.0 indicates
the presence of HPV DNA sequences in the specimen. An RLU measurement less
than the Cutoff Value indicates the absence of the specific HPV DNA sequences
tested or HPV DNA levels below the detection limit of the assay.  

**HPV PCR Assay**

**HPV Summary Variable**

The HPV PCR Summary variable (LBDHPCR) indicates if at least one type is
positive (LBDHPCR=1), the sample is negative (LBDHPCR=2), the sample is
inadequate (LBDHPCR=3), or the sample is missing (LBDHPCR=.).

**Detection Limits**

If data is qualitative, the use of lower limits of detection (LLODs) is not
applicable.

Please refer to the [NHANES Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
