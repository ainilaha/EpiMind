### Personal Care and Consumer Product Chemicals and Metabolites (EPHPP_H)

####  Data File: EPHPP_H.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2016

#####  Last Revised: September 2016

## Component Description

Beginning in NHANES 2013-2014, the Environmental Phenols and Parabens dataset
(formerly EPH) was combined with the Pesticides - Environmental - Urine
dataset (formerly PP) and renamed Personal Care and Consumer Product Chemicals
and Metabolites (EPHPP_H).

Biomonitoring of environmental phenols, parabens, and triclocarban is used to
assess prevalence and relevance of exposure in public health. The routes of
human exposure to these compounds include industrial pollution, pesticide use,
food consumption, and use of personal care products.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and
epoxy resins, which can be used in protective coatings on food containers and
as composites and sealants in dentistry. Concerns over potential health risks
of BPA have led to restrictions on the use of BPA in certain baby and children
products (U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2014). BPA alternatives, such as
bisphenol S (BPS, 4,4'-sulfonyldiphenol) and bisphenol F (BPF,
4,4′-dihydroxydiphenylmethane), have been introduced in the market to replace
BPA (Liao et al. 2012). Some phenols are used as sunscreen agents for skin
protection, and as UV filters in cosmetic products and plastics to improve
stability (e.g., benzophenone-3). Phenols are also used as bactericides (e.g.,
triclosan) in soap and are found in other personal care products. Other
chlorophenols have been used in the wood preservation industry as
intermediates in the production of pesticides, and as disinfectants or
fungicides for industrial and indoor home use. The manufacture of certain
chlorinated aromatic compounds can also produce chlorophenols as byproducts.

Parabens, a group of alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl) esters of
p-hydroxybenzoic acid, are widely used as antimicrobial preservatives in
personal care products, and can also be used in pharmaceuticals, as well as in
food and beverage processing.

Triclocarban (3,4,4'-trichlorocarbanilide) can be used as an antimicrobial
agent in consumer and personal care products (e.g., bar soap), as well as in
cleansing preparations in hospitals and other medical settings.

## Eligible Sample

Examined participants aged 6 years and older from a one-third sample were
eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

A sensitive method for measuring BPA, benzophenone-3, triclosan, four
parabens, two dichlorophenols, and triclocarban was developed based on a
previously published approach (Zhou et al, 2014). The method uses on-line
solid phase extraction coupled to high performance liquid chromatography and
tandem mass spectrometry. With the use of isotopically labeled internal
standards, the detection limits in 100 μL of urine are 0.1 - 1.7 micrograms
per liter (μg/L), sufficient for measuring urinary levels of phenols,
parabens, and triclocarban in non-occupationally exposed subjects.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for detailed laboratory procedure
manual(s) of the methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle.  

## Laboratory Method Files

[Personal Care and Consumer Product Chemicals and Metabolites
](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/labmethods/EPHPP_H_MET.pdf)
(Updated September 2016)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.  
  
Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES [Laboratory Procedures Manual
(LPM)](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).
Vials are stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions
are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2013-2014/manuals/2013_mec_laboratory_procedures_manual.pdf).  
  
**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**  
  
Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.  
  
**Analytical Laboratories**  
  
NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.  
  
NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules (Westgard et al, 1981) used
when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any problems
encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for
each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any
special considerations are submitted to NCHS. The reports are reviewed for
trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any
identified areas of concern.  
  
All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill et al, 2008)).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the 2013-2014 [Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2013)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

**Subsample weights**

Urinary environmental phenols, parabens and triclocarban were measured in a
one third subsample of persons 6 years and older. Special sample weights are
required to analyze these data properly. Specific sample weights for this
subsample are included in this data file and should be used when analyzing
these data.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**  
  
The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted with the key survey
design and basic demographic variables. The [NHANES 2013-2014 Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2013)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.  
  
This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier (i.e., SEQN).  
  
**Detection Limits**  
  
The detection limits were constant for all of the analytes in the data set.
Two variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable name
ending in "LC" (ex., URDBPHLC) indicates whether the result was below the
limit of detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the
limit of detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of
detection. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of
detection (ex., URDBPHLC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte
results field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by square
root of 2 (LLOD/sqrt[2]). The other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXBPH)
provides the analytic result for that analyte.  
  
The lower limits of detection (LLOD, in μg/L) for the environmental phenols,
parabens, and triclocarban are:

Variable Name | SAS Label | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URXBP3 | Urinary Benzophenone-3 (µg/L) | 0.4  
URXBPH | Urinary Bisphenol A (µg/L) | 0.2  
URXBPF | Urinary Bisphenol F (ug/L) | 0.2  
URXBPS | Urinary Bisphenol S (ug/L) | 0.1  
URXTLC | Urinary Triclocarban (µg/L) | 0.1  
URXTRS | Urinary Triclosan (µg/L) | 1.7  
URXBUP | Butyl paraben (µg/L) | 0.1  
URXEPB | Ethyl paraben (µg/L) | 1.0  
URXMPB | Methyl paraben (µg/L) | 1.0  
URXPPB | Propyl paraben (µg/L) | 0.1  
URXDCB | Urinary 2,4-dichlorophenol (µg/L) | 0.1  
URX14D | Urinary 2,5-dichlorophenol (µg/L) | 0.1  
  
Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES [Tutorial](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/tutorials/) for further
details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.
