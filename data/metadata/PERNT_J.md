## Component Description

**Urinary Perchlorate**

Perchlorate has been used as an oxidant in solid fuel propellants for rockets
and missiles since the 1950s. Lesser amounts of perchlorate are used in
matches and fireworks. Perchlorate can also form naturally in the environment
and can accumulate in nitrate-rich mineral deposits mined for use in
fertilizers. Drinking water, milk, and certain plants with high water content
(e.g., lettuce) can be the main sources of perchlorate intake for humans.
Perchlorate has been used medically to treat hyperthyroidism. Its inhibitory
effect on thyroid hormone production has led to concerns that exposure even to
low levels of perchlorate in the environment might affect vulnerable groups,
such as pregnant women with inadequate iodine intake and infants for whom
thyroid hormone levels must be maintained adequately for normal brain
development. Perchlorate taken into the body is rapidly eliminated in the
urine, within a matter of hours. Measurement of urinary perchlorate is useful
to assess recent human exposure.

**Urinary Nitrate and Thiocyanate**

Nitrate and thiocyanate are polyatomic anions that can disrupt thyroid
function by competitively inhibiting iodide uptake, similar to the action of
perchlorate. Nitrate, thiocyanate, and perchlorate can reversibly bind to the
sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) protein resulting in reduced iodine absorption
by the thyroid. Nitrate, thiocyanate and perchlorate interact additively to
impair iodide uptake by the thyroid. Therefore, assessment of the impact of
perchlorate exposure on thyroid function should include assessment of nitrate
and thiocyanate exposure. By assessing exposure to each of the three
physiologically relevant NIS-inhibitors, the relative impact of each chemical
on thyroid function can be estimated and appropriate regulatory action taken
if exposures are negatively impacting thyroid hormone levels. Impaired thyroid
function can lead to hypothyroidism, proliferative thyroid lesions, and
impaired neurodevelopment in infants.

Nitrate poisoning can also lead to methemoglobinemia, primarily in infants.
The prevalence of nitrate exposure is likely due to nitrate intake from both
food and drinking water, with foods (e.g., vegetables, milk, dairy products)
thought to account for the majority of nitrate intake for typical American
adults. Nitrate anion can also form endogenously. Public health prevention
efforts have reduced the prevalence of methemoglobinemia in the United States.
A reference range for urinary nitrate will provide useful information relevant
to nitrate poisoning and subclinical methemoglobinemia in the U.S.

Thiocyanate is also a biomarker of cyanide exposure from tobacco smoke or
diet. Thiocyanate primarily forms in the body as a metabolite of cyanide from
tobacco smoke or cyanogenic foods, such as cassava. Exposure to toxic levels
of cyanide can result from numerous chemical reactions. Lower levels of
thiocyanate can also be found in milk, dairy products, and some vegetables.
Therefore, a defined reference range for thiocyanate will provide useful
benchmark data in case of a cyanide exposure event.

## Eligible Sample

All examined participants aged 3 to 5 years were eligible and participants
aged 6 years and older from a one-third subsample were eligible.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

This method is a quantitative procedure for the measurement of nitrate,
perchlorate, and thiocyanate in human urine using ion chromatography coupled
with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Chromatographic separation is
achieved using an IonPac AS16 column with sodium hydroxide as the eluent. The
eluent from the column is ionized using an electrospray interface to generate
and transmit negative ions into the mass spectrometer. Comparison of relative
response factors (ratio of native analyte to stable isotope labeled internal
standard) with known standard concentrations yields individual analyte
concentrations.

Refer to the Laboratory Method Files section for a detailed description of the
laboratory methods used.

There were no changes to the lab method, lab equipment, or lab site for this
component in the NHANES 2017-2018 cycle.

## Laboratory Method Files

[Urinary Perchlorate, Nitrate, and Thiocyanate Laboratory Procedure
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/labmethods/PERNT-J-
MET-508.pdf) (September 2022)

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens were processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta GA for analysis.

Detailed instructions on specimen collection and processing are discussed in
the [NHANES Laboratory Procedures
Manual](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).
Vials were stored under appropriate frozen (-30Â°C) conditions until they were
shipped to National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

The NHANES quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) protocols meet the
1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments mandates. Detailed QA/QC
instructions are discussed in the [NHANES
LPM](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/2017-2018/manuals/2017_MEC_Laboratory_Procedures_Manual.pdf).

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured competency assessment evaluation during
visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the quality-
control procedures. Each laboratory staff member is observed for equipment
operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures and
constructive feedback are given to each staff member. Formal retraining
sessions are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were
maintained.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all CDC and
contract laboratories, which outlined the use of Westgard rules (Westgard, et
al. 1981) when running NHANES specimens. Progress reports containing any
problems encountered during shipping or receipt of specimens, summary
statistics for each control pool, QC graphs, instrument calibration, reagents,
and any special considerations are submitted to NCHS quarterly. The reports
are reviewed for trends or shifts in the data. The laboratories are required
to explain any identified areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Sciences' quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision,
similar to the Westgard rules (Caudill, et al, 2008).

## Data Processing and Editing

The data were reviewed. Incomplete data or improbable values were sent to the
performing laboratory for confirmation.

## Analytic Notes

Refer to the [2017-2018 Laboratory Data
Overview](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/continuousnhanes/overviewlab.aspx?BeginYear=2017)
for general information on NHANES laboratory data.

Please refer to the NHANES [Analytic
Guidelines](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/analyticguidelines.aspx) and the
on-line NHANES
[Tutorial](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/tutorials/default.aspx) for
further details on the use of sample weights and other analytic issues.

**Subsample Weights**

For participants aged 3-5, their WTSA2YR are equivalent to their MEC exam
sample weights. These participants have completed at least one physical exam
component in the MEC; therefore, they all have an exam sample weight larger
than "0," regardless of their lab test results. For participants 6 years and
older, special sample weights were created for the subsample. These special
weights accounted for the additional probability of selection into the
subsample, as well as the additional nonresponse to these lab tests.
Therefore, if a participant 6 years and older was selected as part of the one-
third subsample, but did not provide a blood specimen, their sample weight
value is assigned as "0" in their record.

**Demographic and Other Related Variables**

The analysis of NHANES laboratory data must be conducted using the appropriate
survey design and demographic variables. The [NHANES Demographic Data
File](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/search/datapage.aspx?Component=Demographics&CycleBeginYear=2017)
contains demographic data, health indicators, and other related information
collected during household interviews as well as the sample design variables.
The recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and
PSU variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data
file.

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES data files using
the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

Starting in the 2015-2016 NHANES cycle, the variable URXUCR (urine creatinine)
will not be reported in this file. URXUCR can be found in the data file titled
"Albumin & Creatinine - Urine".

**Detection Limits**

The detection limits were constant for the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named ending
in "LC" (ex., URDUP8LC) indicates whether the result was below the limit of
detection: the value "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection, "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection. The
other variable prefixed URX (ex., URXUP8) provides the analytic result for the
analyte. For analytes with analytic results below the lower limit of detection
(ex., URDUP8LC=1), an imputed fill value was placed in the analyte results
field. This value is the lower limit of detection divided by the square root
of 2 (LLOD/sqrt [2]).

**The lower limits of detection (LLOD, in ng/mL) for urinary perchlorate,
nitrate, and thiocyanate:**

VARIABLE NAME | ANALYTE DESCRIPTION | LLOD  
---|---|---  
URXUP8 | Perchlorate, urine (ng/mL) | 0.05  
URXNO3 | Nitrate, urine (ng/mL) | 700  
URXSCN | Thiocyanate, urine (ng/mL) | 20
