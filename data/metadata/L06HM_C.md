### Metals - Urine (L06HM_C)

####  Data File: L06HM_C.xpt

#####  First Published: July 2007

#####  Last Revised: NA

## Component Description

Trace metals have been associated with adverse health effects in occupational
studies or laboratory studies, but have not been monitored in general
population groups.

This method is used to achieve rapid and accurate quantifications of multiple
elements of toxicological and nutritional interest. The method is sensitive
and rapid enough to screen urine specimens from subjects suspected to be
exposed to a number of important toxic elements or to evaluate environmental
or other nonoccupational exposure to these same elements.

## Eligible Sample

Participants aged 6 years and older who met the subsample requirements.

## Description of Laboratory Methodology

Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a multi-element
analytical technique (1). Liquid samples are introduced into the ICP through a
nebulizer and spray chamber carried by a flowing argon stream. By coupling
radio-frequency power into flowing argon, plasma is created in which the
predominant species are positive argon ions and electrons. The sample passes
through a region of the plasma that has a temperature of 6000-8000 K. The
thermal energy atomizes the sample and then ionizes the atoms. The ions, along
with the argon, enter the mass spectrometer through an interface that
separates the ICP from the mass spectrometer, which is operating at an
atmospheric pressure of 10-5 torr. The mass spectrometer permits ions at each
mass to be detected in rapid sequence, allowing individual isotopes of an
element to be determined. Electrical signals resulting from the detection of
the ions are processed into digital information that is used to indicate first
the intensity of the ions and then the concentration of the element. The ICP-
MS method is used to measure the following 12 elements in urine: beryllium
(Be), cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), cesium (Cs),
barium (Ba), tungsten (W), platinum (Pt), thallium (TI), lead (Pb), and
uranium (U). This method is based on the method by Mulligan et al. (2) Urine
samples are diluted 1+9 with 2% (v/v), double-distilled, concentrated nitric
acid containing both iridium (Ir) and rhodium (Rh) for multi-internal
standardization. This procedure can be used for all 12 elements or subsets of
the 12 elements.

## Laboratory Quality Assurance and Monitoring

Urine specimens are processed, stored, and shipped to the Division of
Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for analysis.

Detailed specimen collection and processing instructions are discussed in the
NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technologists Procedures Manual (LPM). Vials are
stored under appropriate frozen (-20°C) conditions until they are shipped to
National Center for Environmental Health for testing.

**Mobile Examination Centers (MECs)**

Laboratory team performance is monitored using several techniques. NCHS and
contract consultants use a structured quality assurance evaluation during
unscheduled visits to evaluate both the quality of the laboratory work and the
quality-control procedures. Each laboratory staff person is observed for
equipment operation, specimen collection and preparation; testing procedures
and constructive feedback are given to each staff. Formal retraining sessions
are conducted annually to ensure that required skill levels were maintained.

The NHANES QA/QC protocols meet the 1988 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act
mandates. Detailed QA/QC instructions are discussed in the NHANES LPM.

**Analytical Laboratories**

NHANES uses several methods to monitor the quality of the analyses performed
by the contract laboratories. In the MEC, these methods include performing
blind split samples collected on "dry run" sessions. In addition, contract
laboratories randomly perform repeat testing on 2.0% of all specimens.

NCHS developed and distributed a quality control protocol for all the contract
laboratories which outlined the Westgard rules used when running NHANES
specimens. Progress reports containing any problems encountered during
shipping or receipt of specimens, summary statistics for each control pool, QC
graphs, instrument calibration, reagents, and any special considerations are
submitted to NCHS and Westat quarterly. The reports are reviewed for trends or
shifts in the data. The laboratories are required to explain any identified
areas of concern.

All QC procedures recommended by the manufacturers were followed. Reported
results for all assays meet the Division of Laboratory Science's quality
control and quality assurance performance criteria for accuracy and precision
(similar to specifications outlined by Westgard 1981).

## Analytic Notes

**Subsample weights**

Measures of urinary heavy metals were measured in a one third subsample of
persons 6 years and over. Special sample weights are required to analyze these
data properly. Specific sample weights for this subsample are included in this
data file and should be used when analyzing these data.

**Variance estimation**

The analysis of NHANES 2003-2004 laboratory data must be conducted with the
key survey design and basic demographic variables. The NHANES 2003-2004
Demographic Data File contains demographic and sample design variables. The
recommended procedure for variance estimation requires use of stratum and PSU
variables (SDMVSTRA and SDMVPSU, respectively) in the demographic data file.

**Links to NHANES Data Files**

This laboratory data file can be linked to the other NHANES 2003-2004 data
files using the unique survey participant identifier SEQN.

**Detection Limits**

The detection limit was variable for many of the analytes in the data set. Two
variables are provided for each of these analytes. The variable named LBD___LC
indicates whether the result was below the limit of detection. There are two
values: "0" and "1". "0" means that the result was at or above the limit of
detection. "1" indicates that the result was below the limit of detection.
Urinary beryllium, cadmium, lead, platinum, tungsten, and uranium have
multiple lower limits of detection in this data file. The other variable named
LBX___ provides the analytic result for that analyte. In cases, where the
result was below the limit of detection, the value for that variable is the
detection limit divided by the square root of two.

**URXUCD and URDUCD:**

When comparing urine cadmium across two-year cycles please note that even
though these two variables have different names the data is comparable.
Variable URXUCD is used in 1999-2000 and 2003-2004 and variable URDUCD was
used in 2001-2002. Variable URDUCD was derived to correct for molybdenum
interference (Reference to 2001-2002 lab 6 heavy metal documentation).
Beginning in 2003-2004 the urinary cadmium data is corrected at the testing
laboratory for molybdenum interference.

Please refer to the Analytic Guidelines for further details on the use of
sample weights and other analytic issues.
